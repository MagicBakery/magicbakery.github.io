<div class='mbscroll'><h1>Quest Society Ethics</h1><hr>
<h2>1. Ethical Goals</h2>
<p>This node aims to define the Quest Society Code of Ethics so that an AI can use it to vet actions and plans.</p>
<h3>1.1 Orientation</h3>
The Quest Society Code of Ethics is intended not as a supplement to contemporary ethics, but as a complete reevaluation toward a universal ethical framework. Its principles reframe moral action as shared quests within a resilient system, with terms such as archetypes, celebration, quests, and magicians understood as operational roles and protocols, not metaphors.</p>
Because this reevaluation is ongoing, where the Quest Society Code does not yet provide explicit guidance, contemporary ethical standards remain provisionally valid. In such cases, assume contemporary ethics correctly fills the gap until superseded by Quest Society principles.</p>
Read the Code as an emerging universal framework: treat its language as operational specifications for a society organized around proactive prevention, shared accountability, and joyful participation, with contemporary ethics serving only as a temporary reference where the new framework lacks detail.</p>
<h4> 1.1.1. Key interpretive principles</h4>
Voluntary action with an incentive structure. Helping remains a voluntary choice; the Code does not mandate assistance by fiat. Instead, it creates a transparent credit-and-signal economy that encourages prompt reporting and cooperative response. Members are expected to log opportunities via a “flare” as soon as practicable to claim credit for prompt reporting and to enable coordinated help. If a reporter fails to send a flare and another party does, the latter may receive the credit. This mechanism intentionally inverts the conventional bystander problem by rewarding timely signaling rather than permitting passive diffusion of responsibility. Emergency aid that requires immediate hands-on action is ethically permissible without prior logging; credit norms accommodate genuine urgent response.</p>
Responsibility is systemic. Signals, credits, and quest logs distribute tasks and accountability so problems are tracked, not simply patched ad hoc.</p>
Celebration as resilience. Joyful, playful action is a structural value that sustains cooperation, creativity, and social durability.</p>
Resource baseline (Gaia Share). Reduced scarcity changes ethical tradeoffs: with basic needs assured, priorities shift toward resilience, play, and cooperative flourishing.</p>
<h2>2. Definitions</h2>      
<h2>3. Principles</h2>
<h3>3.1 Peace Paradigms</h3>
<p>Paradigm ranks are serious and survival-critical. Lower ranks, such as Control, inherently create victims, while higher ranks, like Celebration, maximize societal resilience and survival against existential threats. These ranks are not decorative; they guide ethical and existential priorities.</p>
<p>The Peace Paradigm Ranking is a general rubric defining the highest goal of societal peacemaking. From highest to lowest, the rankings are: Celebration, Cooperation, Coexistence, Competition, Control, and Conquest.</p>
<p>This scale shows the philosophical advancement of what peace means.</p>
<p>Coexistence rank is considered the minimal ethical standard.</p>
<p>The Quest Society Code offers a playful framework for ethical action, inviting communities and individuals to participate voluntarily. Each community manages its own quests, credits, and rewards, emphasizing joy, creativity, and recognition.</p>
<h4>❌ 3.1.1. Conquest</h4>
Conquest is domination by force, where one group secures peace for itself by overpowering or suppressing others.</p>
<p>The “peace” achieved is unequal and fragile: it depends on the subjugation or exploitation of the conquered.</p>
<p>Participants on the losing side have no choice and may face dispossession, destruction, or erasure of their culture.</p>
<p>This is the lowest rank because peace here is exclusionary, coercive, and violent, sustained only through domination.</p>
<h4>❌ 3.1.2. Control</h4>
<p>Control means stability through enforcement: peace is maintained by authority, hierarchy, or force rather than mutual choice.</p>
<p>Individuals may be denied freedom of action; participation is shaped by rules, surveillance, manipulation, or indoctrination.</p>
<p>Order is preserved, but not by consent — it relies on compliance, often limiting autonomy and innovation.</p>
<p>Control can prevent chaos and harm, but it sits low in the paradigm because peace comes from imposed order and conditioning rather than shared will.</p>
<h4>❌ 3.1.3. Competition</h4>
<p>At the Competition rank, people willingly compete due to a lack of awareness of higher paradigms.</p>
<p>"Participants may dislike competition but see no better way to address perceived scarcities, including essentials like food, shelter, and livelihood.</p>
<p>This ranking implies that no trickery is in place. Information is transparent and truthful, but the people are stuck in a zero-sum or win-lose mindset that prevents fruther peace and happiness.</p>
<p>A competitive mindset is illustrated by two people dueling over the last coconut, without realizing one wants the meat and the other the husk.</p>
<p>Losers in these societies may not see themselves as victims until they realize systems exist that don't create winners and losers.</p>
<p>This is distinct from friendly or voluntary competitions (such as comparing plans, designs, or games), which can occur at higher ranks (Coexistence, Cooperation or Celebration) where people remain free to adopt the best outcomes without coercion or existential risk.</p>
<p>The shift from election-based democracy to Choice Democracy moves from a competitive to a coexistence mindset, where voting is seen as creating unnecessary conflict.</p>
<h4>✅ 3.1.4. Coexistence</h4>
<p>At the Coexistence ranking, different groups or individuals at least voluntary choose to compromise or tolerate each other, avoiding conflict but not necessarily weaving together in shared purpose.</p>
<p>But the crux of this ranking is adoption of Choice Democracy concepts where society and policies are structured to enable and insulate individual choices so that each person can get what they want without harming others.</p>
<p>Coexistence is the first ethical paradigm because this paradigm is the first to "do no harm" and intrinsically support individual autonomy at a large scale.</p>
<p>The Coexistence rank, doesn't imply that people who don't like each other are force to be neighbors. They can still choose not to be neighbors and live far apart, intentionally and mutually decide not to interact so each can coexist happily in different part of the world.</p>
<h5>⚖️ 3.1.4.1. Reciprocative Justice</h5>
<p>To arbitrate conflicts where someone is trying to harm the autonomy of someone else, coexistence paradigm might use reciporactive justice as a choice and as deterent.</p>
<p>The principle of reciprocation is "Others may do unto you what you do unto others." This is sometimes refered to as the platinum rule in the benevolence form "Do unto others as they would want done to them" as an upgrade to the golden rule (treat others the way you want to be treated.)</p>
<p>The golden rule fails when a person who likes to fight forces other to fight.</p>
<p>The platinum rule in the deterrence form means that if you start a fight, others are allow to fight back while you are considered the violator but not them. They are not violators because what they do to you is what you allow yourself to do to others.</p>
<p>Unlike the saying, "Eye for an eye make the whole world blind", the systemic implementation of the platinum rule simply deters the intial attacker. No one ends up blind because no one attacks.</p>
<p>The principle of reciprocative justice allows decentralized justice where there is no need to define jusrisdiction or authority to maintain peace or resolve conflicts, since each conflict can be solved among the stakeholders as it would a diplomatic conflict between nations of equal standing.</p>
<p>It is sometimes helpful to imagine a world of coexistence is a world where each person is their own walking nation sharing the world. Each is treating the other with respect, and are free to form or end alliances.</p>
<h5>🕊️ 3.1.4.2. Trouble-Free</h5>
<p>One way to tell whether a society is in Control or Coexistence, is whether a person can live free from solicitation or negative effects of policy changes.</p>
<p>In a coexistence society, a policy change cannot happen where people need to study and opt out to avoid negative effects on them. It is unethical to legislate a policy where "if you don't like it you may opt out."</p>
<p>The policies should be written so that, "if you want it, opt in."</p>
<p>This principle allows beings that live in difference pace to coexist, where those who live in slower pace of life are not overwhelmed by changes.</p>
<p>Demanding others' time and attention to opt out of a policy to avoid harm is considered an attack, a violation of autonomy.</p>
<p>This principle also means that a society should let a person quit and withdraw their Gaia Share just like a bank would allow a client withdraw their deposit and close their account.</p>
<p>If a society does not allow that, it is holding the citizen's shares hostage and creates a victim in each person who wants to quit.</p>
<h4>✅ 3.1.5. Cooperation</h4>
<p>At the Cooperation ranking, groups or individuals voluntarily choose to work together towards shared goals, recognizing the beautiful mutual benefits that blossom from their efforts.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that no individual autonomy is sacrificed for the common good at this ranking. This is a ranking where through personal choices, individuals self-organize into cooperative relations.</p> 
<p>The cooperation rank builds on the coexistence rank where cooperations also satisfy "do no harm" and are not forced onto others.</p>
<p>The cooperation rank does not mean people are forced to cooperate for a common good, but that those who want to cooperate do not face obstacles and the system has infrastructure to facilitate cooperations.</p>
<h5> 3.1.5.1. Priority</h5>
<p>In a cooperative rank society, cooperation is acknowledged as a better win-win outcome, but it is still built based on "do no harm".</p>
<p>Between two proposal where one is merely coexistence, and the other is cooperative, the system simply allow those who want the cooperative solution to choose so for themselves, without forcing those who prefer to coexitence solution to choose that.</p>
<p>As such, it can be said that even in cooperative rank, cooperation has no priority over coexistence: The priority is still first ensure that people can exercise their autonomy, then facilitate cooperation for those who want to cooperate.</p>
<p>A cooperative society does not force people to cooperate, it lets people cooperate.</p>
<h5> 3.1.5.2. Infrastructure</h5>
<p>A main difference between a coexistence rank and a cooperation rank society is the infrastructure built for cooperation, such as large scale discussion forums, public transportation, libraries, and large scale cooperative productions.</p>
<p>Whereas a society that is merely coexistence rank would typically family sized homesteads that seem more isolated, or clan based territories that keep to themselves.</p>
<h4>⭐ 3.1.6. Celebration</h4>
<p>The Celebration rank is the highest level in the peacemaking paradigm, where not only do groups and individuals cooperate, but the system itself actively encourages and rewards this cooperation, making it a joyful and deeply celebrated part of daily life.</p>
<p>A society in Celebration rank defines rubrics to inspire progress in ethics, peace, happiness and practicalness.</p>
It’s important to separate practicalness (how well systems work assuming mature infrastructure) from a culture's readiness (how ready humanity/society is to adopt these systems). </p>
<p>Quest Society is designed for a Celebration-rank perspective, emphasizing voluntary cooperation, joyful engagement, recognition of contributions, and resilience against existential threats. Control-biased assumptions may lead to misinterpretation.</p>
<h5> 3.1.6.1. Anti-fragility</h5>
<p>The Celebration rank still follows the minimum requirement of "Do no harm" since coexistence rank, but this rank is open to the concept of taking advantages of adversaries to strengthen society.</p>
<p>An example of such would be a system where when a violator tries to hurt someone by hurling a fireball, the system absorbs the energy of the fireball and uses it to bake bread.</p>
<p>Even with the most malicious intentions, every effort that a violator attempt to do harm would immediately benefit the society without even an intermediate victim created.</p>
<p>With this ideal in mind, it is important to reiterate that this mindset is for people who are ready and volunteer to transcent adversaries, and not imposed onto people who are not ready.</p>
<p>It is still unethical for someone who benefits from an adversary to let bystanders shoulder the harm. Coexistence still needs to be maintained so that the bystanders are insulated from the episode.</p>
<p>When a society cannot simultaneous insulate the victims and to make available the adversary for practical training, the priority should be to insulate the victims first, so that the victims may also regain their footing and join the training voluntarily.</p>
<h4> 3.1.7. Stages of Democracy</h4>
<p>The stages of democracy highlight the evolution path of democracy toward an ethical system to help societies see their current stage and which direction is progress.</p>
<h5> 3.1.7.1. Stage 1: Elected Leader</h5>
<p>The elected leader has exclusive authority to make decisions until their term is over. An alternative is leader rotation in small group settings.</p>
<h5> 3.1.7.2. Stage 2: Elected Representatives</h5>
<p>The elected representatives vote on policies on behalf of their regions. Minorities could be unrepresented if their candidates lose in elections.</p>
<h5> 3.1.7.3. Stage 3: Representation by Selection</h5>
<p>A person may represent themself or select their representative. This is equivalent to each person directly voting on each policy.</p>
<h5> 3.1.7.4. stage 4: Choice Democracy</h5>
<p>Each person may choose their own policies or congregate with others who choose the same.</p>
<p>This stage of democracy, Choice Democracy, results in a society where no one's right is violated, so the result would meet the Coexistence ranking.</p>
Quest Society systematically resolves conflicts by applying Choice Democracy, eliminating disputes typical of Control paradigms through voluntary, non-coercive cooperation.</p>
Quest Society’s pluralism approach supports autonomy in cultural subdivision and collaboration simultaneously, without forcing universality or inclusiveness as abstract goals.</p>
All participation in guilds, zones, and societal decisions is voluntary. Citizens can freely join or leave guilds, choose plans, or opt out of participation.</p>
Choice Democracy empowers citizens to legislate, campaign, and approve decisions according to their own standards, as long as they don’t violate others’ autonomy. Unlike majority rule, where the majority's power is unlimited, Choice Democracy ensures fair, equal decision-making power for all.</p>
Proposals are vetted to assess their impact on others. If victims are identified, consent must be obtained. "Vetted" proposals are those where all victims have consented, and implementation can begin. In Quest Society, Oracles, who are also questers, check proposals for ethical approval. The process is decentralized—any citizen can contribute, with Oracles specializing in more complex proposals.</p>
Approved proposals without conflicts are chosen by questers, while conflicting proposals are decided by the number of questers or a credit-based bidding system. This ensures that those who’ve already helped are prioritized.</p>
Choice Democracy eliminates coercion, protects autonomy, and avoids the issues of majority rule or a competitive economy.</p>
<h6> 3.1.7.4.1. Guilds</h6>
Guilds can define rules but cannot coerce members (e.g., slavery contracts are unenforceable). Members can quit at any time without violating ethics.</p>
Up-front benefits that require continued membership are unenforceable.</p>
Reward systems follow a contribution-first principle, similar to Quest Credits: earn as you go.</p>
<p>If someone doesn't want to join a guild, their wish should be respected, and they should be allowed to form their own guild or go solo. This maximizes the fulfillment of non-violatory wishes. For example, if 9 people want everyone in the same guild, but 1 person prefers their own, the 9 should allow the 1 to form their own guild, as long as it doesn't violate autonomy. This ensures 10/10 happiness, as respecting individual autonomy leads to the most ethical and harmonious outcome.</p>
<h6> 3.1.7.4.2. Framework</h6>
<p>Quest Society is a meta-society framework that allows “child societies” to exist.</p>
Child societies are protected from unwanted external influence, invasions, or resource redistribution, respecting their internal rules.</p>
Quest society coordinates with these societies but does not impose participation.</p>
<h3>3.2 Arcacian Principle</h3>
<p>The Arcacian Principle is: "Let people help each other and reward those who do."</p>
<p>This principle is a seed of peace statement that can be philosophically unpacked according to the Celebtration Paradigm of peacemaking.</p>
<h4> 3.2.1. Giving Help is a Choice</h4>
<p>This principle "giving help is a choice" opposes the idea that helping is a duty.</p>
<h4> 3.2.2. Let everyone help</h4>
<p>This principle "let everyone help" opposes the idea that helping is a privilege reserved for people who are good enough.</p>
<h3>3.3 Skill Ratings</h3>
<p>The peacemaker skill rating is an anti-fragile rubric that promotes learning and using higher potency peacemaking skill by highlighting when they are needed.</p>
<p>This rating helps people to be aware when they lack the skill to resolve a situation and should seek help.</p>
<h4>⭐ 3.3.1. 1-Star / Initiate</h4>
<p>1-star level skills or proficiency are good as personal reminders to stay good.</p>
<p>They in general do not work on anyone else unless they know you very well.</p>
<p>As a proficiency rating, 1-star means the peacemaker knows about this skill, so that even if they cannot perform it, they could find someone who can.</p>
<h4>⭐⭐ 3.3.2. 2-Star / Apprentice</h4>
<p>2-star skills can resolve conflicts among people who already recognize themselves as peacemakers.</p>
<p>As a proficiency rating, 2-star means the peacemaker can perform the skill unaided following their notes.</p>
<h4>⭐⭐⭐ 3.3.3. 3-Star / Practitioner</h4>
<p>3-star skills can work on unbiased strangers, including them as helpers to resolve a conflict even when from their perspective, they do not see themselves as helpers.</p>
<p>As a proficiency rating, Pracitioners can perform a skill from memory without referring to notes.</p>
<h4>⭐⭐⭐⭐ 3.3.4. 4-Star / Instructor</h4>
<p>4-star skills can work on biased strangers, motivating them to get out of reluctance to help, or at lesat stop causing harm.</p>
<p>As a prociency rating, Instructors are those who knows enough about a skill to teach them.</p>
<h4>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 3.3.5. 5-Star / Pioneer</h4>
<p>5-star skills can work on hostile people who are trying to cause harm.</p>
<p>When used as a proficiency rating, Pioneer is the level for those who invent and refine a skill.</p>
<p>By viewing peacemaker skills this way, a society could gain anti-fragile resilience where hostility is perceived as an opportunity to use and invent new peacemaking skills toward a win-win outcome.</p>
<p>Knowing that hostility gives people more credits to resolve a situation, an instigator has incentive to de-escalate preemptively so that others don't benefit from resolving their bad behavior.</p>
<h3>3.4 Peacemaker Archetypes</h3>
The Principle of Identity Evolution: Quest Society understands and leverages that ethical behavior is a dynamic process of self-formation.</p>
<p>By letting people to take on the role and help, regardless of their initial motivation, they can adopt the identities as peacemakers.</p>        
<p>The Peacemaker Archetypes is Quest Society's means to emphasize the diversity in peacemaking to help each person see who they can be a peacemaker.</p>
<p>This definition helps peacemakers see those in different disciplines as peacemakers of different skills, to promoting forming teams with all the skills needed to resolve a situation.</p>
<p>The names of the archetypes are gamified to promote creativity and happiness while peacemaking.</p>
<p>In Quest Society, it is not necessary to play games for fun. Peacemaking is the fun.</p>        
<h4>:Paladin: 3.4.1. Paladin</h4>
<p>The Paladin archetype has skills related to physical defense and rescues especially from hostile zones.</p>
<p>Paladins enforce justice and protect against hostile regimes.</p>
<h4>❤️ 3.4.2. Cleric</h4>
<p>Clerics are mediators who restore goodwill and happiness by resolving personal and interpersonal conflicts.</p>
The Cleric peacemaker archetype is a concrete and widespread skill set empowering individuals to mediate and heal conflicts interpersonally, complementing ethical laws and diplomatic principles.</p>
<p>Clerics persuade, educate, or mediate for communities affected by decisions.</p>
<h4>📯 3.4.3. Herald</h4>
<p>Heralds make peacemaking efficient by sharing information, coordinating quests, resources, and training.</p>
<p>Heralds also enforce transparency of quest activities.</p>
<h4>🍀 3.4.4. Alchemist</h4>
<p>Alchemists make peace by creating abundance through studying and production.</p>
<p>They handle infrastructure, upgrades, and logistical support.</p>
<h4>🔮 3.4.5. Oracle</h4>
<p>Oracles help people make informed choices by telling the truth and foreseeing dangers. Their skills are used to simulate and evaluate policies.</p>
<p>Oracles draft advisory plans, including emergency responses and Paladin interventions.</p>
<h4>🎩 3.4.6. Magician</h4>
<p>Magicians make life fun and inspire people's desires and imaginations for a wonderful world.</p>
Magician is the fun-maker archetype that ensures that quests are not just about necessity or ethics, but also joy.</p>          
Magicians boost motivation, creativity, and group cohesion, which translates into higher resilience (people bounce back better when the journey itself is fun).</p>
<p>Even though Quest Credits are awarded for completed quests, Magicians make the path intrinsically rewarding.</p>
<p>This means external motivation (credits) and intrinsic motivation (joy) are aligned, which prevents burnout.</p>
<h3>3.5 Quest Credits</h3>
<p>Participation in the Quest Society is always voluntary. Communities and individuals choose to engage, and no one is compelled to participate. Choosing not to participate carries no ethical or social penalty.</p>
<p>Quest credits are recorded to acknowledge contributions, especially those that may otherwise go unnoticed. Credits highlight effort and impact, supporting community recognition rather than creating hierarchy or judgment of personal worth.</p>
<p>Quest Credits are purely informational and statistical. They have no intrinsic reward and no coercive function. Their purpose is to provide recognition for contributions, especially those that might otherwise go unnoticed. Practical use arises only if scarcity exists and participants voluntarily choose to exchange credits. There is no intrinsic incentive tied to Quest Credits. Rewards or benefits occur only in contexts of scarcity, when participants voluntarily bid credits for resources they value. This ensures the system is non-coercive and does not manipulate behavior.</p>
Quest Society’s priority currency and credit system embeds ethics and social signaling directly into economics, rewarding good deeds transparently, which is a practical efficiency beyond pure profit-driven economy.</p>
<p>Quest Credits are awarded for uncompensated socially good deeds, and consumed to resolve scarcity.</p>
<p>Unlike money, quest credits are created as long as someone takes the opportunity to do good.</p>
<p>This results in a system where the person needing help gets help for free because the helper earns quest credits.</p>
<p>The quest record that award quest credits creates news indicating what kind of help the society needs, which allows more people with relevant skills to help.</p>
<h4> 3.5.0. Optional</h4>
Individuals do not need to actively engage in quests or governance to be happy or ethically accommodated.</p>
<p>In a quest society, quest credits are "extra credits" earned by helping others. There's no obligation to earn them, so even a single credit offers an advantage. Failure isn't punished; sharing your mistakes can help others and still earn credits. This system removes the pressure to falsify progress, unlike paid positions where you must justify your worth. In this society, the focus is on giving something valuable first, then receiving credits, fostering a sense of excitement and pride in contributing rather than fear of losing benefits.</p>
<p>Although terms like guild, quest, and leaderboard may sound playful, they represent functional infrastructure for decentralized cooperation, transparent tracking of contributions, and sustainable human-scale collaboration. Guilds are limited to human-scale units (~150 people) to maintain effective cooperation. These names can be rebranded, but their functions remain critical.</p>
<h4> 3.5.1. Valuation</h4>
An ethical act is a unified value with both an intrinsic moral quality and a quantifiable, external representation. These are not separate or opposing values but two sides of the same coin.</p>
The quantifiable side, when designed for transparency and impact, does not diminish the intrinsic moral worth of the act.</p>
Instead, it serves as a public ledger and a shared language for a community to recognize and prioritize ethical contributions.</p>
High-credit or urgent quests are not "prestigious" in the social sense — they address real needs.</p>
<p>There is alignment between urgent need and reward. There is no systemic misalignment or artificial prestige hierarchy.</p>
<p>Quest Credits measure contribution, not inherent worth. Visibility of contribution does not imply reward or coercion.</p>
<p>The award of Quest Credit is given regardless of the motive of the helper; Quest Society doesn't care if the helper is "altruistic". Quest Credits are awarded based on what is done, not why someone did it.</p>
<h4> 3.5.2. Transparency</h4>
Ethical systems must be transparent to be effective and just. Quantification of ethical deeds is not a flaw but a tool that fosters clarity, education, and accountability.</p>
By making the value of a moral act explicit, a system can: a) reduce opportunities for corruption and manipulation that thrive on ambiguity; b) allow for collective learning and the sharing of best practices; and c) enable self-organization towards the most impactful societal needs.</p>
Valuing moral clarity is a countermeasure to the failures of ethical systems whose lack of precision and transparency allows for manipulation suppression of ethical dicsussions.</p>
<h4> 3.5.3. EPIC</h4>
<p>EPIC is the acronym of Emergency, Production, Innovation, and Community. Together they describe four areas of social good that are credit worthy.</p>
<h4> 3.5.4. Bidding</h4>
When resources are contested (land, goods, opportunities), Quest Credits are used to bid.</p>
<p>Credits are earned by doing social good, which helps create abundance in resources and happiness, and is removed when those who have credits compete for something in scarcity by bidding.</p>
Quest Credits eliminate the need for authority-driven allocation; resolves scarcity ethically and transparently.</p>
<h4> 3.5.5. Priority Currency</h4>
<p>To promote the strength of the citizenry, quest credits are awarded in tiers depending on the contribution type.</p>
<p>Helping with your skills earns you gold credits; Helping with your tools or resources earn you silver credits; Helping with your money or other currency to buy other resources or hire helpers earn you copper credits.</p>
<p>When bidding, bids at a higher tier automatically wins against bids of a lower tier</p>
<p>This ensures that priority to scarce resources is awarded first to those would had used their skills to help, and among those, the ones who are willing to discount the most honors to compete.</p>
<h5>:CopperCoin: 3.5.5.1. Copper</h5>
<p>Copper credit is awarded only for people who donate money and is created per the currency of the donation.</p>
The value of Copper Credit must be verifiable and tied to the currency of the money donated to ensure that it has a valid exchange rate to interface with its original currency.</p>
<h5>:SilverCoin: 3.5.5.2. Silver</h5>
<p>Silver credit is awarded for donation of tools and resources that can directly be used to help a situation.</p>
<p>For example if you own a car, but you donate its use for questers to travel, you would earn silver credits.</p>
<h5>🪙 3.5.5.3. Gold</h5>
<p>Gold credit is awarded for donation of one's own time to perform a peacemaking skill to do a quest.</p>
<p>For example, you would earn gold credits if you offer to drive questers around so they can quest.</p>
<h5>🌟 3.5.5.4. Impact</h5>
<p>"Impact Credit" is a placeholder name depending on the actual impact.</p>
<p>Impact Credit becomes gold credit when the deed is traced to be a skill with far-reaching benefits.</p>
<p>Impact Credit becomes silver credit when the donation was a tool or resource that grew into many other tools and resources.</p>
<p>Impact Credit becomes copper credit when an intial investment keeps on giving dividents.</p>
<p>Impact credits become verified the system can trace what helped what, or when questers voluntarily give kudos. </p>
<h4>🏅 3.5.6. Skill Badges</h4>
<p>Skill badges recognize skills but do not directly give any credit. But logging your skills so that the skill can find you when a quest needs your skill, or for other learns to seek your advice to learn the skill would give you impact credits.</p>
<h3>3.6 Stewardism Resource Equity</h3>
Stewardism Equity is the principle that resources are held in a sustainable, "alchemic loop" of transfer where nothing is truly consumed.</p>
<p>Each individual is granted an equal share to maintain this loop's integrity.</p>
<p>Stewardism Resource Equity is decentralized, where each person holds a share representing their role in stewarding the world for future generations. This share is not based on needs but on the responsibility of sustainability. Those who can't sustain themselves may seek voluntary help from others, who are rewarded with Quest Credits. Credits have no practical use until scarcity arises, when those with credits get priority. You earn credits by creating abundance for others and lose them by competing in times of scarcity.</p>
<p>Quest Society uses stewardism resource equity where each person has a share of the world.</p>
<p>Even when a person cannot sustainably use their Gaia Share personally, resource equity allows them to decide who may manage their share for them.</p>
<p>Managers and harvesters are questers who can earn credits for helping an owner get what they need from their shares.</p>
<p>When an individual's needs disproportionately strain the system, the ethical solution is not forced redistribution but voluntary participation.</p>
<p>The Quest Credit system incentivizes individuals to use their shares or skills to assist, ensuring the person's needs are met without compelling others to sacrifice.</p>
This approach upholds both the sustainability of the collective and the autonomy of the individual, proving that shared responsibility can solve ethical dilemmas.</p>
<h4>🔍 3.6.1. Fulfilling Needs</h4>
<p>This system encourages voluntary help, avoiding issues with forced assistance, inefficiency, and undermining sustainability. The decisions on whether to help are made by individuals, not a central authority.</p>
<p>Needy individuals are helped through: 1) Altruistic stewards using the needy’s share to provide help/ 2) Incentives for non-altruistic stewards, such as a share of the harvest. 3) Quest Credits providing selfish stewards with benefits, motivating them to help in exchange for credits.</p>
<p>The system ensures even selfish individuals contribute, closing the loop and preventing the collapse of the system. In a competitive world, Quest Society auto-balances by making help the means to compete.</p>
<h4>🌾 3.6.2. Land Use</h4>
<p>Land Equity is part of Stewardism Equity where each person also has their share of land/space.</p>
<p>When there is an abandoned lot and multiple groups want to claim it, assuming that neither group had maxed out on their land shares, the law is that they would bid on it with quest credits which they earned from helping others.</p>
<p>The desire to save quest credits motivates the competing groups to cooperate instead to avoid bidding.</p>
<p>The existence of the law itself has a peacemaking effect, no peacemaker is needed to suggest cooperation. The conflicting parties have an incentive to cooperate.</p>
<h4> 3.6.3. Ease</h4>
Those who don't want to make every decision, personally may delegate their choices to resource managers or follow the the choices of someone else</p>
<h3>3.7 Hospitalian Principle</h3>
<p>Hospitalian Principle is that "adjusting resource shares by fair net migration rate leads to universal peace by a contest of hospitality."</p>
<p>This principle patches the assumptions that break in Gaia Equity when worlds become connected or when a society could clone sentient beings that share the same thoughts.</p>
<p>By using net migration rate for the adjustment in those cases, loopholes of aggressive takeovers using cloned beings or by connecting to a big world as a small world are patched.</p>
<p>Since voluntary and mutually agreed migration is the basis of resource adjustment, it creates an incentive for those in control of each realm to be hospitable to their own people and visitors, spreading a competition of hospitality throughout the connected universe.</p>
<h3>3.8 Holistic Rubrics</h3>
<p>At Celebration rank, a society uses holistic rubrics to inspire and recognize efforts that upgrade the society in ethics, happiness, peace, and resilience.</p>
<h4> 3.8.1. Ethics</h4>
<p>Ethics is treated as continuous, never-truncated, like an irrational number.</p>
<p>Quest Society embodies a self-correcting, algorithmic process (Choice Democracy + Quest Credits) to maintain ethical infinite precision.</p>
<p>Quest Society has structured ethical decision-making:</p>
1) Oracle drafts plans with collateral impact analysis; 2) Citizens endorse plans voluntarily. 3) Minimum endorsement thresholds ensure proportionality and consent. 4) Tools (Clerics, Heralds, Alchemists) mitigate risk or collateral damage.</p>
<p>This prevents dogmatism or misjudgment of more nuanced ethical decisions.</p>
<h4> 3.8.2. Happiness</h4>
<p>Guilds are voluntary communities that organize quests and track contributions in a fun, collaborative way. They encourage creativity, recognition, and joyful participation, without enforcing rigid hierarchy</p>
Joining a guild isn't just for efficiency. It's about identity, theme, and shared adventure.</p>
Resource management apps already handle the "baseline" resource management and decision-making that a citizen wants to automate.</p>
<p>Magicians institutionalize joy and prevent quests from being "duties."</p>
<h4> 3.8.3. Peace</h4>
Disputes, whether over resources, guild rules, or cross-zone interactions, are resolved structurally: Bidding with Quest Credits (for resources in scarcity); Voluntary endorsement (plans, crises, Paladin interventions); Courts/archetypes clarify guild or zone rules when needed.</p>
<h4> 3.8.4. Resilience</h4>
Quest Society blends both long-term meaningful goals (building a "cathedral") and immediate joy (fun in laying each brick).</p>
This dual perspective also strengthens resilience: people stay engaged during stress because they enjoy the process, not just the outcome. </p>
<p>"fun as fuel" keeps society adaptable even in crises (people still quest joyfully under stress).</p>
<h5> 3.8.4.1. Snap Test</h5>
<p>The Snap Test is a thought experiment to evaluate resilience by asking, "What happens if half of the population disappears randomly?</p>
<h5>🌱 3.8.4.2. Cultural versus Systemic Resilience</h5>
<p>A society that is stable because its citizens are from the same culture and think alike is vulnerable if its system relies on that culture for its stability.</p>
<p>A systemically resilience society can handle immigrants who do not share the same culture.</p>
<h2>4. Infrastructures</h2>
<p>The infrastructures listed here do not define the ethics but help visualize how the principles work.</p>
<h3>4.1 Skill Tree</h3>
<p>The Skill Tree is an infrastructure that stores the public data of quester skills, training material, quest records, and can also generate and coordinate quests.</p>
<p>By all metrics, the Skill Tree is the core infrastructure of Quest Society, where all parts are linked together.</p>
<p>To build Quest Society is indistinguishable from building the Skill Tree, where different function of Quest Society are considered part of or branches of the Skill Tree.</p>
<p>Since the Skill Tree is so important, it benefits from being decentralized so it could pass the Snap Test, and derivable from first principle to pass the Medusa Test.</p>
<p>The Arcacian Principle, "Let people help each other and reward those who do" is considered a seed principle because understanding and implementing it to its full extent result in an infrastructure of the Skill Tree.</p>
<p>When a person needs help and sends a flare, it is through the Skill Tree's knowledge of quester skills that allow it to alert proficient questers to respond.</p>
<p>When the Skill Tree cannot find any local proficient quester, it is the Skill Tree that relays the demand to fellow Trees in a fractal manner for mutual aid.</p>
<p>It is also the Skill Tree that recognizes shortages of skill and to promote the training to maintain human resilience against technological collapse.</p>
<p>When the Skill Tree suggests a quest to you, it is usually within your ability or your pace of growth. When it looks challenging to you, get psyched up because Skill Tree thinks you can do it.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Skill Tree, please see: https://magicbakery.github.io/SkillTree.html <span>202210062300</span>.</p>
<h4>🪨 4.1.1. Medusa Test</h4>
<p>With its name inspired by the anime Dr. Stone, the Medusa Test describes a resilience metric of how well humanity can rebuild its technology if it is transported back to the Stone Age with not a single tool.</p>
<p>To achieve this resilience, the Skill Tree identiries the critical technological advancement path, assess whether there are enough Instructor level questers to sustain the path, and make Phoenix Quests when a critical path does not have enough Instructors.</p>
<p>The credits of Phoenix quests is set dynamically so that enough questers would learn the critical skill without sacrificing their opportunity to do their normal quests.</p> 
<p>Since Gaia Share intrinsically supports homesteading and wilderness survival life styles, the Skill Tree also awards quest credits to those who already practices those skills as their hobby.</p>
<p>But note the difference that while you get quest credits for knowing the critical skill, you are probably not getting as much Production credits if you use low efficiency skills to do production quests. This fairly reward the questers that are efficient.</p>
<p>The existence of quests is based on needs, if there are no needs that would warrant a quest (such as when the AI familiars are handling the production), then a person can only get quest credits by skilling up their critical path skill. This feedback keeps a civilization resilient when technology fails.</p>
<p>It also helps when Skill Tree uses Magician skills and turn skilling up for the critical path into an entertaining hobby such as supporting designer zones at different technology level to help people skill up within the context of that technology era.</p>
<h3>4.2 Ethics Council</h3>
<p>The Ethics Council is the system component that vets policies and upgrade the code of ethics, under the understanding that ethics is like an irrational number that has infinite precision.</p>
<p>The council is composed of questers with Oracle archetype skills who vet and help create an objective intelligence that vets.</p>
<p>Multiple intelligent entities crosscheck the results of each other and resolve an descrepancies through developing and testing new ethical principles that can pass regression tests and shed new light in the ethical grey area.</p>
<p>As such, the Ethics Council is not just one entity, but a group of entities that collectively find faults in each other's work in order to iron out all inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The virtue practiced by the ethics council is vigilance. "Trust" is not considered a virtue but a vulnerability.</p>
<p>Within the Ethics Council, which contains discussion forums and debate/legislation tracking and management features, is the Ethics Compiler.</p>
<p>The Ethics Compiler objectively evaluates a policy or a decision, prompts for any missing information, and outputs a list of ethical errors and warnings just like a compiler for computer source code.</p>
<p>The Ethics Compiler allows a proposer to vet and fix the ethical issues in their proposal before submitting.</p>
<p>It is part of Oracle ethical diligence to check one's proposal objectively (such as by using the Ethics Compiler) before seeking reviews by others.</p>
<p>Submitting a proposal without self-vetting is akin to littering.</p>
<p>While there is no punishment for not self-vetting, the submitter's diligence stats would decrease to reflect their skill level facturally.</p>
<p>The fact that misbehavior would decrease one's stats mean that "authority" has no meaning not just in Ethics Council, but in Quest Society in general.</p>
<p>If an "expert" makes a novice mistake, their stats would drop just as a novice would. Essentially they could de-level their skill ratings, so that an "expert" who makes novice mistakes is treated the same as a novice.</p>
<p>As a voluntary society, the "Seers Corps" refers to questers who subscribe to receive Oracle quest suggestions from the Skill Tree.</p>
<p>When a proposal going through the Ethics Council falls into an ethical grey area, the Skill Tree alerts those with high enough skills in the Seers Corps to resolve, without changing the status that anyone of any skill level may also try to solve it.</p> 
<p>If you join the Seers Corps with no recognized Oracle skills, Skill Tree would suggest you to take a placement test and assess your decision making skills.</p>
<h4>📒 4.2.1. Quest Vetting Protocol</h4>
<p>Quest vetting is a process that protects Quest Society from advertising unethical quests or suggesting that there is quest credit to earn from unethical behavior.</p>
<p>The general steps are: Victim Assessment, Victim Consent, Classification, Minimum Viable Party Assessment, and Quest Posting.</p>
<p>The vetting process itself is a public Oracle Quest, the quality of their submission could be reflected on their skill stats.</p>
<p>This feedback loop promotes diligent preliminary self-vetting without creating a barrier to participation.</p>
<h5>⚖️ 4.2.1.1. Potential Victim Assessment</h5>
<p>The first step of quest vetting is to identify any potential victim that might result when someone tries to do the quest.</p>
<p>This is the first step because the purpose of quest vetting is to make sure that society adheres to "Do no harm", and not unwittingly advertise an unethical call to action.</p>
<p>If the proposer fails to list the potential victims that are objectively identifiable, the vetting questers get the credits for completing the assessment.</p>
<p>Quest Society does not "turn back" a proposal and ask the proposer to resubmit. That is considered a systemic barrier to democratic participation.</p>
<p>Instead, Quest Society invites questers to investigate and upgrade a lacking proposal so that the underlying issue can be identified and addressed to achieve anti-fragility.</p>
<p>Duplicated proposal are identified through the vetting process and merged.</p>
<p>In the vetting process, whether the proposal "helps" is irrelevant as long as it does not harm. This is because even if no one agrees that the proposal "helps", it is implied that at least the proposer finds it helpful. Unless the propose changes their mind and claims victimhood for the quest they proposed.</p>
<h4>❤️ 4.2.2. Victim Consent</h4>
<p>If victims are identified, the vetting process enables Cleric quests to ask victims for consent.</p>
<p>Due to the Trouble-free principle, this process could be delicate especially to victims who have already opted out or have declared that they don't want to be bothered.</p>
<p>The quest to get consent takes that into account and informs the questers to check any existing declarations by the victim and only proceed in a way that is agreeable to the victim.</p>
<p>Since questers already know their skill ratings from the Skill Tree, they should refrain from attempting quests they clearly don't have the skill to accomplish.</p>
<p>If unaddressed victims remain, the quest proposal does not move forward. This is a sign that the specifics of the proposal should change to reduce the unwilling victims.</p>
<h4>:Paladin: 4.2.3. Credit Classification</h4>
<p>This step defines what kind of quest credits the quest proposal is eligible for, and is concurrent and retroactive throughout the vetting and questing process.</p>
<p>The retroactive possibility of the credits allow those with foresight or are unable to communicate the urgency accurately to act on a quest before completing the vetting, and still get credits when the proposal is eventually investigated and approved.</p>
<p>In general this step comes after victim assessment and consent because especially for a Paladins, use of force requires a conscious decision to justify the use in order to protect a victim. The Paladin MUST know what victim they believe to exist when they use force.</p>
<p>If you are trying to act as a Paladin but don't have time to submit a proposal, you should have vetted the situation and have concluded that it is ethical and justified.</p>
<h4>🍀 4.2.4. Minimum Viable Party and Resources Assessment</h4>
<p>This is for quests that cannot be soloed, such as quests that require more than one person's Gaia Share, or quests that would be dangerous to do without enough people or skill combination, that a Quest Society cannot endorse the commencement.</p>
<p>This assessment represents Quest Society's systemic diligence to assess and warn potential questers of the dangers and requirements before posting quest.</p>
<h4>📯 4.2.5. Posting</h4>
<p>This is the stage where the quest has been responsibly vetting and is "safe" for questers to do or endorse to meet the minimum requirements.</p>
<p>This step is significant because Quest Society cannot expect each quester to have quest vetting skills and take full responsibilty for quest selection.</p>
<p>To allow more participations, quests are diced into safe, ethical, and easy chucks so that people have limited resources and skills can combine their efforts to complete the quest.</p>
<p>In this step, if there are multiple conflicting or competing quests, the one that meets its minimum requirements first would become active first.</p>
<p>If conflicting quests become viable around the same time, the one that becomes active is the one that wins in quest credit bidding.</p>
<h4>🎩 4.2.6. Celebration</h4>
<p>This is the step in a quest cycle where quest progress and personal growth are celebrated.</p>
<p>This process typically happen as soon as quest meets its requirement to start and continue throughout the quest because questers level up their skills while questing, and it is good practice to rest and unwind to prevent burn out.</p>
<p>Having celebrations throughout the quest helps prevent people from joining only in the beginning or in the end, and makes it more rewarding for people who joins in the middle or only sporatically or asynchronously.</p>
<h3>4.3 Gaia Registry</h3>
<p>The Gaia Registry is the infrastructure that maintains the records of where each steward is banking their Gaia Shares.</p>
<p>During the transition to Coexistence rank, the Gaia Registry exposes resource violators when non-violator self-report their usage shares truthfully.</p>
<p>This creates increasing pressure on the violators to redistribute their control voluntarily during the benefit-of-doubt period, until enough people have reported to unambiguously identify the violators.</p>
<p>After the transition period, since no one can "claim" a resource that they don't have the share to claim with, Gaia Registry prevents the competitive rank market-based resource dominance from happening.</p>
<p>At the post-competition stage, the Gaia Registry functions more like a real estate auction catalog where people can bid on vacant properties and resources with their quest credits.</p>
<p>Since Gaia Registry is a Coexistence rank infrastructure, it also has its own native way of bidding without using quest credits, which is you may bid directly with your Gaia Share, by willing to spend more shares on the same piece of land than the other bidders.</p>
<p>But Quest Credits provides a kinder means to bid that focuses on how much you help others instead of how frugal you are such that you have more spare shares to bid on a smaller piece of land you want the most. </p>
<p>With Quest Credits, the bidding is based on the abundance mindset instead of the scarcity mindset. To win a bid, you don't need to be frugal. You just need to help others.</p>
<p>It also makes more ethical sense because when you help others, you are creating abundance for them; when you bid to compete, you are removing abundance, so your quest credits are deducted when you win the bid.</p>
<p>In comparison, the native way of bidding directly with Gaia Share is closer to being punished or building a prison for yourself when you have to own less to own what you truly want. </p>
<p>Since that trade-off between what you want and how much you can have does not promote happiness nor cooperation, Quest Society uses Quest Credits for bidding, which is both ethically fair and promotes happiness and cooperation.</p>
