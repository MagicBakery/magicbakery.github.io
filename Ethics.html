<div class='mbscroll'><h1>Quest Society Ethics</h1><hr>
<h2>1. Ethical Goals</h2>
<p>This node aims to define the Quest Society Code of Ethics so that an AI can use it to vet actions and plans.</p>
<h3>1.1 Orientation</h3>
The Quest Society Code of Ethics is intended not as a supplement to contemporary ethics, but as a complete reevaluation toward a universal ethical framework. Its principles reframe moral action as shared quests within a resilient system, with terms such as archetypes, celebration, quests, and magicians understood as operational roles and protocols, not metaphors.</p>
Because this reevaluation is ongoing, where the Quest Society Code does not yet provide explicit guidance, contemporary ethical standards remain provisionally valid. In such cases, assume contemporary ethics correctly fills the gap until superseded by Quest Society principles.</p>
Read the Code as an emerging universal framework: treat its language as operational specifications for a society organized around proactive prevention, shared accountability, and joyful participation, with contemporary ethics serving only as a temporary reference where the new framework lacks detail.</p>
<h4> 1.1.1. Key interpretive principles</h4>
Voluntary action with an incentive structure. Helping remains a voluntary choice; the Code does not mandate assistance by fiat. Instead, it creates a transparent credit-and-signal economy that encourages prompt reporting and cooperative response. Members are expected to log opportunities via a “flare” as soon as practicable to claim credit for prompt reporting and to enable coordinated help. If a reporter fails to send a flare and another party does, the latter may receive the credit. This mechanism intentionally inverts the conventional bystander problem by rewarding timely signaling rather than permitting passive diffusion of responsibility. Emergency aid that requires immediate hands-on action is ethically permissible without prior logging; credit norms accommodate genuine urgent response.</p>
Responsibility is systemic. Signals, credits, and quest logs distribute tasks and accountability so problems are tracked, not simply patched ad hoc.</p>
Celebration as resilience. Joyful, playful action is a structural value that sustains cooperation, creativity, and social durability.</p>
Resource baseline (Gaia Share). Reduced scarcity changes ethical tradeoffs: with basic needs assured, priorities shift toward resilience, play, and cooperative flourishing.</p>
<h2>2. Definitions</h2>      
Ethics refers to a formalized set of rules or principles that define what is good and right within a society, profession, or community. These rules are often codified in a visible and objective manner, such as in a "Code of Ethics."</p>
Morality, on the other hand, is a person’s internal, intrinsic sense of right and wrong: their “moral compass.” This internal sense guides individual judgments and behaviors based on deeply held values and beliefs.</p>
<p>By studying and adopting a code of ethics, a person can internalize its principles, effectively recalibrating their moral compass.</p>
This process involves retraining one's intrinsic sense of justice so that their personal moral judgments align more closely with the conclusions and standards embodied in the code of ethics.</p>
<h2>3. Principles</h2>
<h3>3.1 Peace Paradigms</h3>
<p>Paradigm ranks are serious and survival-critical. Lower ranks, such as Control, inherently create victims, while higher ranks, like Celebration, maximize societal resilience and survival against existential threats. These ranks are not decorative; they guide ethical and existential priorities.</p>
<p>The Peace Paradigm Ranking is a general rubric defining the highest goal of societal peacemaking. From highest to lowest, the rankings are: Celebration, Cooperation, Coexistence, Competition, Control, and Conquest.</p>
<p>This scale shows the philosophical advancement of what peace means.</p>
<p>Coexistence rank is considered the minimal ethical standard.</p>
<p>The Quest Society Code offers a playful framework for ethical action, inviting communities and individuals to participate voluntarily. Each community manages its own quests, credits, and rewards, emphasizing joy, creativity, and recognition.</p>
<h4>❌ 3.1.1. Conquest</h4>
Conquest is domination by force, where one group secures peace for itself by overpowering or suppressing others.</p>
<p>The “peace” achieved is unequal and fragile: it depends on the subjugation or exploitation of the conquered.</p>
<p>Participants on the losing side have no choice and may face dispossession, destruction, or erasure of their culture.</p>
<p>This is the lowest rank because peace here is exclusionary, coercive, and violent, sustained only through domination.</p>
<h4>❌ 3.1.2. Control</h4>
<p>Control means stability through enforcement: peace is maintained by authority, hierarchy, or force rather than mutual choice.</p>
<p>Individuals may be denied freedom of action; participation is shaped by rules, surveillance, manipulation, or indoctrination.</p>
<p>Order is preserved, but not by consent — it relies on compliance, often limiting autonomy and innovation.</p>
<p>Control can prevent chaos and harm, but it sits low in the paradigm because peace comes from imposed order and conditioning rather than shared will.</p>
<h4>❌ 3.1.3. Competition</h4>
<p>At the Competition ranking, competition is structural and unavoidable: people are forced to compete for survival, resources, or recognition.</p>
<p>Participants may be unwilling, yet must take part to secure their basic means of life (food, shelter, livelihood).</p>
<p>This ranking implies that no trickery is in place. Information is transparent and truthful, but the people can still be stuck in a paradigm, such as zero-sum or win-lose mindset, that prevents fruther peace and happiness.</p>
<p>Losers in these societies might not see themselves as systemic victims until they learn that there are systems without losers, that they do not need to participate in a competitive system that creates winners and losers.</p>
<p>This is distinct from friendly or voluntary competitions (such as comparing plans, designs, or games), which can occur at higher ranks (Coexistence, Cooperation or Celebration) where people remain free to adopt the best outcomes without coercion or existential risk.</p>
<h4>✅ 3.1.4. Coexistence</h4>
<p>At the Coexistence ranking, different groups or individuals at least voluntary choose to compromise or tolerate each other, avoiding conflict but not necessarily weaving together in shared purpose.</p>
<p>But the crux of this ranking is adoption of Choice Democracy concepts where society and policies are structured to enable and insulate individual choices so that each person can get what they want without harming others.</p>
<p>Coexistence is the first ethical paradigm because this paradigm is the first to "do no harm" and intrinsically support individual autonomy at a large scale.</p>
<p>The Coexistence rank, doesn't imply that people who don't like each other are force to be neighbors. They can still choose not to be neighbors and live far apart, intentionally and muturally decide not to interact so each can coexist happily in different part of the world.</p>
<h5>⚖️ 3.1.4.1. Reciprocative Justice</h5>
<p>To arbitrate conflicts where someone is trying to harm the autonomy of someone else, coexistence paradigm might use reciporactive justice as a choice and as deterent.</p>
<p>The principle of reciprocation is "Others may do unto you what you do unto others." This is sometimes refered to as the platinum rule in the benevolence form "Do unto others as they would want done to them" as an upgrade to the golden rule (treat others the way you want to be treated.)</p>
<p>The golden rule fails when a person who likes to fight forces other to fight.</p>
<p>The platinum rule in the deterrence form means that if you start a fight, others are allow to fight back while you are considered the violator but not them. They are not violators because what they do to you is what you allow yourself to do to others.</p>
<p>Unlike the saying, "Eye for an eye make the whole world blind", the systemic implementation of the platinum rule simply deters the intial attacker. No one ends up blind because no one attacks.</p>
<p>The principle of reciprocative justice allows decentralized justice where there is no need to define jusrisdiction or authority to maintain peace or resolve conflicts, since each conflict can be solved among the stakeholders as it would a diplomatic conflict between nations of equal standing.</p>
<p>It is sometimes helpful to imagine a world of coexistence is a world where each person is their own walking nation sharing the world. Each is treating the other with respect, and are free to form or end alliances.</p>
<h5>🕊️ 3.1.4.2. Trouble-Free</h5>
<p>One way to tell whether a society is in Control or Coexistence, is whether a person can live free from solicitation or negative effects of policy changes.</p>
<p>In a coexistence society, a policy change cannot happen where people need to study and opt out to avoid negative effects on them. It is unethical to a policy where "if you don't like it you may opt out."</p>
<p>The policies should be written so that, "if you want it, opt in."</p>
<p>This principle allows beings that live in difference pace to coexist, where those who live in slower pace of life are not overwhelmed by changes.</p>
<p>Demanding others' time and attention to opt out of a policy to avoid harm is considered an attack, a violation of autonomy.</p>
<h4>✅ 3.1.5. Cooperation</h4>
<p>At the Cooperation ranking, groups or individuals voluntarily choose to work together towards shared goals, recognizing the beautiful mutual benefits that blossom from their efforts.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that no individual autonomy is sacrificed for the common good at this ranking. This is a ranking where through personal choices, individuals self-organize into cooperative relations.</p> 
<p>The cooperation rank builds on the coexistence rank where cooperations also satisfy "do no harm" and are not forced onto others.</p>
<p>The cooperation rank does not mean people are forced to cooperate for a common good, but that those who want to cooperate do not face obstacles and the system has infrastructure to facilitate cooperations.</p>
<h5> 3.1.5.1. Priority</h5>
<p>In a cooperative rank society, cooperation is acknowledged as a better win-win outcome, but it is still built based on "do no harm".</p>
<p>Between two proposal where one is merelyl coexistence, and the other is cooperative, the system simply allow those want want the cooperative solution to choose so for themselves, without forcing those who prefer to coexitence solution to choose that.</p>
<p>As such, it can be said that even in cooperative rank, cooperation has no priority over coexistence: The priority is still first ensure that people can exercise their autonomy, then facilitate cooperation for those who want to cooperate.</p>
<p>A cooperative society does not force people to cooperate, it lets people cooperate.</p>
<h5> 3.1.5.2. Infrastructure</h5>
<p>A main difference between a coexistence rank and a cooperation rank society is the infrastructure built for cooperation, such as large scale discussion forums, public transportation, libraries, and large scale cooperative productions.</p>
<p>Whereas a society that is merely coexistence rank would typically family sized homesteads that seem more isolated, or clan based territories that keep to themselves.</p>
<h4>⭐ 3.1.6. Celebration</h4>
<p>The Celebration rank is the highest level in the peacemaking paradigm, where not only do groups and individuals cooperate, but the system itself actively encourages and rewards this cooperation, making it a joyful and deeply celebrated part of daily life.</p>
<p>A society in Celebration rank defines rubrics to inspire progress in ethics, peace, happiness and practicalness.</p>
It’s important to separate practicalness (how well systems work assuming mature infrastructure) from a culture's readiness (how ready humanity/society is to adopt these systems). </p>
<p>Quest Society is designed for a Celebration-rank perspective, emphasizing voluntary cooperation, joyful engagement, recognition of contributions, and resilience against existential threats. Control-biased assumptions may lead to misinterpretation.</p>
<h5> 3.1.6.1. Anti-fragility</h5>
<p>The Celebration rank still follows the minimum requirement of "Do no harm" since coexistence rank, but this rank is open to the concept of taking advantages of adversaries to strengthen society.</p>
<p>An example of such would be a system where when a violator tries to hurt someone by hurling a fireball, the system absolves the energy of the fireball and uses it to bake bread.</p>
<p>Even with the most malicious intentions, every effort that a violator attempt to do harm would immediately benefit the society without even an intermediate victim created.</p>
<p>With this ideal in mind, it is important to reiterate that this mindset is for people who are ready and volunteer to transcent adversaries, and not imposed onto people who are not ready.</p>
<p>It is still unethical for someone who benefits from an adversary to let bystanders shoulder the harm. Coexistence still needs to be maintained so that the bystanders are insulated from the episode.</p>
<p>When a society cannot simultaneous insulate the victims and to make available the adversary for practical training, the priority should be to insulate the victims first, so that the victims may also regain their footing and join the training voluntarily.</p>
<h4> 3.1.7. Stages of Democracy</h4>
<p>The stages of democracy highlight the evolution path of democracy toward an ethical system to help societies see their current stage and which direction is progress.</p>
<h5> 3.1.7.1. Stage 1: Elected Leader</h5>
<p>The elected leader has exclusive authority to make decisions until their term is over. An alternative is leader rotation in small group settings.</p>
<h5> 3.1.7.2. Stage 2: Elected Representatives</h5>
<p>The elected representatives vote on policies on behalf of their regions. Minorities could be unrepresented if their candidates lose in elections.</p>
<h5> 3.1.7.3. Stage 3: Representation by Selection</h5>
<p>A person may represent themself or select their representative. This is equivalent to each person directly voting on each policy.</p>
<h5> 3.1.7.4. stage 4: Democracy by Choices</h5>
<p>Each person may choose their own policies or congregate with others who choose the same.</p>
<p>This stage of democracy, Choice Democracy, results in a society where no one's right is violated, so the result would meet the Coexistence ranking.</p>
Quest Society systematically resolves conflicts by applying Choice Democracy, eliminating disputes typical of Control paradigms through voluntary, non-coercive cooperation.</p>
Quest Society’s pluralism approach supports autonomy in cultural subdivision and collaboration simultaneously, without forcing universality or inclusiveness as abstract goals.</p>
All participation in guilds, zones, and societal decisions is voluntary. Citizens can freely join or leave guilds, choose plans, or opt out of participation.</p>
Choice Democracy empowers citizens to legislate, campaign, and approve decisions according to their own standards, as long as they don’t violate others’ autonomy. Unlike majority rule, where the majority's power is unlimited, Choice Democracy ensures fair, equal decision-making power for all.</p>
Proposals are vetted to assess their impact on others. If victims are identified, consent must be obtained. "Vetted" proposals are those where all victims have consented, and implementation can begin. In Quest Society, Oracles, who are also questers, check proposals for ethical approval. The process is decentralized—any citizen can contribute, with Oracles specializing in more complex proposals.</p>
Approved proposals without conflicts are chosen by questers, while conflicting proposals are decided by the number of questers or a credit-based bidding system. This ensures that those who’ve already helped are prioritized.</p>
Choice Democracy eliminates coercion, protects autonomy, and avoids the issues of majority rule or a competitive economy.</p>
Guilds can define rules but cannot coerce members (e.g., slavery contracts are unenforceable). Members can quit at any time without violating ethics.</p>
Up-front benefits that require continued membership are unenforceable.</p>
Reward systems follow a contribution-first principle, similar to Quest Credits: earn as you go.</p>
<p>If someone doesn't want to join a guild, their wish should be respected, and they should be allowed to form their own guild or go solo. This maximizes the fulfillment of non-violatory wishes. For example, if 9 people want everyone in the same guild, but 1 person prefers their own, the 9 should allow the 1 to form their own guild, as long as it doesn't violate autonomy. This ensures 10/10 happiness, as respecting individual autonomy leads to the most ethical and harmonious outcome.</p>
<p>Quest Society is a meta-society framework that allows “child societies” to exist.</p>
Child societies are protected from unwanted external influence, invasions, or resource redistribution, respecting their internal rules.</p>
Quest society coordinates with these societies but does not impose participation.</p>
<h3>3.2 Arcacian Principle</h3>
<p>The Arcacian Principle is: "Let people help each other and reward those who do."</p>
<p>This principle is a seed of peace statement that can be philosophically unpacked according to the Celebtration Paradigm of peacemaking.</p>
<h4> 3.2.1. Giving Help is a Choice</h4>
<p>This principle "giving help is a choice" opposes the idea that helping is a duty.</p>
<p>A helper should not be belittled or pressured to help more than they choose.</p>
<p>If a helper has the skill to help more but is not doing so, instead of blaming them, you could first understand the reason and help them resolve any barrier or fear they have to help more.</p>
<p>Remember that Quest Society has a goal to train many capable helpers, so when someone capable decides "not to help", it creates the opportunity for someone else to gain the experience so the society has more helpers.</p>
<p>By design, Quest Society specifically does not want to discourage people who help even if they seek fame or publicity as their motivation.</p>
<p>Discouraging help based on motivation would violate the Arcacian Principle "Let people help each other and reward those who do."</p>
<p>By allowing those who seek fame to help, and give them fame (through the leaderboard of quest scores), Quest Society does recruits instead of alienate those helpers to have a larger helper base.</p>
<p>For those seeking to be heroes, Quest Society IS the place to be.</p>
The quest board offers jackpot-style rewards to incentivize heroes to tackle challenging quests without blaming those who choose to help less. It is the hero’s internal drive for glory that motivates them to take on harder tasks.</p>
<p>The accounting of credits balances those who tackle challenges and those who do simpler quests, so people don't neglect one for the other. It is a choice for those who can do either.</p>
<p>By setting helping as a choice, it gives helpers more readiness to rest so that they can help more with refreshed perspectives.</p>
<h4> 3.2.2. Let everyone help</h4>
<p>This principle "let everyone help" opposes the idea that helping is a privilege reserved for people who are good enough.</p>
<p>Quest Society supports this ethical principle by not requiring a helper to join any guild to help. They may just help as themself, and credits are tied to individuals who help, not their guild.</p>
<p>Dissect big quests into small pieces so more people with less commitment or skills can also help.</p>
<p>Quest Society defines four areas to highlight the scope of what is quest worthly: Emergency, Production, Innovation, and Community. <span>202207291003</span></p>
<p>The Skill Tree teaches people how to help for free so that more people can choose to help.</p>
<p>You can check out tools from resource library so there is no big upfront investment to start helping.</p>
<p>Gaia Share gives you the fundamental resources to help yourself and others. <span>202209251051</span></p>
<p>There is no interview to go through to start helping. The quality of your help speaks for itself. </p>
<h3>3.3 Skill Ratings</h3>
<p>The peacemaker skill rating is an anti-fragile rubric that promotes learning and using higher potency peacemaking skill by highlighting when they are needed.</p>
<p>This rating helps people to be aware when they lack the skill to resolve a situation and should seek help.</p>
<p>1-star level skills or proficiency are good as personal reminders to stay good.</p>
<p>They in general do not work on anyone else unless they know you very well.</p>
<p>As a proficiency rating, 1-star means the peacemaker knows about this skill, so that even if they cannot perform it, they could find someone who can.</p>
<p>2-star skills can resolve conflicts among people who already recognize themselves as peacemakers.</p>
<p>As a proficiency rating, 2-star means the peacemaker can perform the skill unaided following their notes.</p>
<p>3-star skills can work on unbiased strangers, including them as helpers to resolve a conflict even when from their perspective, they do not see themselves as helpers.</p>
<p>As a proficiency rating, Pracitioners can perform a skill from memory without referring to notes.</p>
<p>4-star skills can work on biased strangers, motivating them to get out of reluctance to help, or at lesat stop causing harm.</p>
<p>As a prociency rating, Instructors are those who knows enough about a skill to teach them.</p>
<p>5-star skills can work on hostile people who are trying to cause harm.</p>
<p>When used as a proficiency rating, Pioneer is the level for those who invent and refine a skill.</p>
<p>By viewing peacemaker skills this way, a society could gain anti-fragile resilience where hostility is perceived as an opportunity to use and invent new peacemaking skills toward a win-win outcome.</p>
<p>Knowing that hostility gives people more credits to resolve a situation, an instigator has incentive to de-escalate preemptively so that others don't benefit from resolving their bad behavior.</p>
<h3>3.4 Peacemaker Archetypes</h3>
The Principle of Identity Evolution: Quest Society understands and leverages that ethical behavior is a dynamic process of self-formation.</p>
<p>By letting people to take on the role and help, regardless of their initial motivation, they can adopt the identities as peacemakers.</p>        
<p>The Peacemaker Archetypes is Quest Society's means to emphasize the diversity in peacemaking to help each person see who they can be a peacemaker.</p>
<p>This definition helps peacemakers see those in different discplines as peacemakers of different skills, to promoting forming teams with all the skills needed to resolve a situation.</p>
<p>The names of the archetypes are gamified to promote creativity and happiness while peacemaking.</p>
<p>In Quest Society, it is not necessary to play games for fun. Peacemaking is the fun.</p>        
<p>The Paladin archetype has skills related to physical defense and rescues especially from hostile zones.</p>
<p>Paladins enforce justice and protect against hostile regimes.</p>
<p>Clerics are mediators who restore goodwill and happiness by resolving personal and interpersonal conflicts.</p>
The Cleric peacemaker archetype is a concrete and widespread skill set empowering individuals to mediate and heal conflicts interpersonally, complementing ethical laws and diplomatic principles.</p>
<p>Clerics persuade, educate, or mediate for communities affected by decisions.</p>
<p>Heralds make peacemaking efficient by sharing information, coordinating quests, resources, and training.</p>
<p>Heralds also enforce transparency of quest activities.</p>
<p>Alchemists make peace by creating abundance through studying and production.</p>
<p>They handle infrastructure, upgrades, and logistical support.</p>
<p>Oracles help people make informed choices by telling the truth and foreseeing dangers. Their skills are used to simulate and evaluate policies.</p>
<p>Oracles draft advisory plans, including emergency responses and Paladin interventions.</p>
<p>Magicians make life fun and inspire people's desires and imaginations for a wonderful world.</p>
Magician is the fun-maker archetype that ensures that quests are not just about necessity or ethics, but also joy.</p>          
Magicians boost motivation, creativity, and group cohesion, which translates into higher resilience (people bounce back better when the journey itself is fun).</p>
<p>Even though Quest Credits are awarded for completed quests, Magicians make the path intrinsically rewarding.</p>
<p>This means external motivation (credits) and intrinsic motivation (joy) are aligned, which prevents burnout.</p>
<h3>3.5 Quest Credits</h3>
<p>Participation in the Quest Society is always voluntary. Communities and individuals choose to engage, and no one is compelled to participate. Choosing not to participate carries no ethical or social penalty.</p>
<p>Quest credits are recorded to acknowledge contributions, especially those that may otherwise go unnoticed. Credits highlight effort and impact, supporting community recognition rather than creating hierarchy or judgment of personal worth.</p>
<p>Quest Credits are purely informational and statistical. They have no intrinsic reward and no coercive function. Their purpose is to provide recognition for contributions, especially those that might otherwise go unnoticed. Practical use arises only if scarcity exists and participants voluntarily choose to exchange credits. There is no intrinsic incentive tied to Quest Credits. Rewards or benefits occur only in contexts of scarcity, when participants voluntarily bid credits for resources they value. This ensures the system is non-coercive and does not manipulate behavior.</p>
Quest Society’s priority currency and credit system embeds ethics and social signaling directly into economics, rewarding good deeds transparently, which is a practical efficiency beyond pure profit-driven economy.</p>
<p>Quest Credits are awarded for uncompensated socially good deeds, and consumed to resolve scarcity.</p>
<p>Unlike money, quest credits are created as long as someone takes the opportunity to do good.</p>
<p>This results in a system where the person needing help gets help for free because the helper earns quest credits.</p>
<p>The quest record that award quest credits creates news indicating what kind of help the society needs, which allows more people with relevant skills to help.</p>
<h4> 3.5.0. Optional</h4>
Individuals do not need to actively engage in quests or governance to be happy or ethically accommodated.</p>
<p>In a quest society, quest credits are "extra credits" earned by helping others. There's no obligation to earn them, so even a single credit offers an advantage. Failure isn't punished; sharing your mistakes can help others and still earn credits. This system removes the pressure to falsify progress, unlike paid positions where you must justify your worth. In this society, the focus is on giving something valuable first, then receiving credits, fostering a sense of excitement and pride in contributing rather than fear of losing benefits.</p>
<p>Although terms like guild, quest, and leaderboard may sound playful, they represent functional infrastructure for decentralized cooperation, transparent tracking of contributions, and sustainable human-scale collaboration. Guilds are limited to human-scale units (~150 people) to maintain effective cooperation. These names can be rebranded, but their functions remain critical.</p>
<h4> 3.5.1. Valuation</h4>
An ethical act is a unified value with both an intrinsic moral quality and a quantifiable, external representation. These are not separate or opposing values but two sides of the same coin.</p>
The quantifiable side, when designed for transparency and impact, does not diminish the intrinsic moral worth of the act.</p>
Instead, it serves as a public ledger and a shared language for a community to recognize and prioritize ethical contributions.</p>
High-credit or urgent quests are not "prestigious" in the social sense — they address real needs.</p>
<p>There is alignment between urgent need and reward. There is no systemic misalignment or artificial prestige hierarchy.</p>
<p>Quest Credits measure contribution, not inherent worth. Visibility of contribution does not imply reward or coercion.</p>
<h4> 3.5.2. Transparency</h4>
Ethical systems must be transparent to be effective and just. Quantification of ethical deeds is not a flaw but a tool that fosters clarity, education, and accountability.</p>
By making the value of a moral act explicit, a system can: a) reduce opportunities for corruption and manipulation that thrive on ambiguity; b) allow for collective learning and the sharing of best practices; and c) enable self-organization towards the most impactful societal needs.</p>
Valuing moral clarity is a countermeasure to the failures of ethical systems whose lack of precision and transparency allows for manipulation suppression of ethical dicsussions.</p>
<h4> 3.5.3. EPIC</h4>
<p>EPIC is the acronym of Emergency, Production, Innovation, and Community. Together they describe four areas of social good that are credit worthy.</p>
<h4> 3.5.4. Bidding</h4>
When resources are contested (land, goods, opportunities), Quest Credits are used to bid.</p>
<p>Credits are earned by doing social good, which helps create abundance in resources and happiness, and is removed when those who have credits compete for something in scarcity by bidding.</p>
Quest Credits eliminate the need for authority-driven allocation; resolves scarcity ethically and transparently.</p>
<h4> 3.5.5. Priority Currency</h4>
<p>To promote the strength of the citizenry, quest credits are awarded in tiers depending on the contribution type.</p>
<p>Helping with your skills earns you gold credits; Helping with your tools or resources earn you silver credits; Helping with your money or other currency to buy other resources or hire helpers earn you copper credits.</p>
<p>When bidding, bids at a higher tier automatically wins against bids of a lower tier</p>
<p>This ensures that priority to scarce resources is awarded first to those would had used their skills to help, and among those, the ones who are willing to discount the most honors to compete.</p>
<h5>:CopperCoin: 3.5.5.1. Copper</h5>
<p>Copper credit is awarded only for people who donate money and is created per the currency of the donation.</p>
The value of Copper Credit must be verifiable and tied to the currency of the money donated to ensure that it has a valid exchange rate to interface with its original currency.</p>
<h5>:SilverCoin: 3.5.5.2. Silver</h5>
<p>Silver credit is awarded for donation of tools and resources that can directly be used to help a situation.</p>
<p>For example if you own a car, but you donate its use for questers to travel, you would earn silver credits.</p>
<h5>🪙 3.5.5.3. Gold</h5>
<p>Gold credit is awarded for donation of one's own time to perform a peacemaking skill to do a quest.</p>
<p>For example, you would earn gold credits if you offer to drive questers around so they can quest.</p>
<h5>🌟 3.5.5.4. Impact</h5>
<p>"Impact Credit" is a placeholder name depending on the actual impact.</p>
<p>Impact Credit becomes gold credit when the deed is traced to be a skill with far-reaching benefits.</p>
<p>Impact Credit becomes silver credit when the donation was a tool or resource that grew into many other tools and resources.</p>
<p>Impact Credit becomes copper credit when an intial investment keeps on giving dividents.</p>
<p>Impact credits become verified the system can trace what helped what, or when questers voluntarily give kudos. </p>
<p>Skill badges recognize skills but do not directly give any credit. But logging your skills so that the skill can find you when a quest needs your skill, or for other learns to seek your advice to learn the skill would give you impact credits.</p>
<h3>3.6 Stewardism Resource Equity</h3>
Stewardism Equity is the principle that resources are held in a sustainable, "alchemic loop" of transfer where nothing is truly consumed.</p>
<p>Each individual is granted an equal share to maintain this loop's integrity.</p>
<p>Stewardism Resource Equity is decentralized, where each person holds a share representing their role in stewarding the world for future generations. This share is not based on needs but on the responsibility of sustainability. Those who can't sustain themselves may seek voluntary help from others, who are rewarded with Quest Credits. Credits have no practical use until scarcity arises, when those with credits get priority. You earn credits by creating abundance for others and lose them by competing in times of scarcity.</p>
<p>Quest Society uses stewardism resource equity where each person has a share of the world.</p>
<p>Even when a person cannot sustainably use their Gaia Share personally, resource equity allows them to decide who may manage their share for them.</p>
<p>Managers and harvesters are questers who can earn credits for helping an owner get what they need from their shares.</p>
<p>When an individual's needs disproportionately strain the system, the ethical solution is not forced redistribution but voluntary participation.</p>
<p>The Quest Credit system incentivizes individuals to use their shares or skills to assist, ensuring the person's needs are met without compelling others to sacrifice.</p>
This approach upholds both the sustainability of the collective and the autonomy of the individual, proving that shared responsibility can solve ethical dilemmas.</p>
<p>This system encourages voluntary help, avoiding issues with forced assistance, inefficiency, and undermining sustainability. The decisions on whether to help are made by individuals, not a central authority.</p>
<p>Needy individuals are helped through: 1) Altruistic stewards using the needy’s share to provide help/ 2) Incentives for non-altruistic stewards, such as a share of the harvest. 3) Quest Credits providing selfish stewards with benefits, motivating them to help in exchange for credits.</p>
<p>The system ensures even selfish individuals contribute, closing the loop and preventing the collapse of the system. In a competitive world, Quest Society auto-balances by making help the means to compete.</p>
<p>Land Equity is part of Stewardism Equity where each person also has their share of land/space.</p>
<p>When there is an abandoned lot and multiple groups want to claim it, assuming that neither group had maxed out on their land shares, the law is that they would bid on it with quest credits which they earned from helping others.</p>
<p>The desire to save quest credits motivates the competing groups to cooperate instead to avoid bidding.</p>
<p>The existence of the law itself has a peacemaking effect, no peacemaker is needed to suggest cooperation. The conflicting parties have an incentive to cooperate.</p>
Those who don't want to make every decision, personally may delegate their choices to resource managers or follow the the choices of someone else</p>
<h3>3.7 Hospitalian Principle</h3>
<p>Hospitalian Principle is that "adjusting resource shares by fair net migration rate leads to universal peace by a contest of hospitality."</p>
<p>This principle patches the assumptions that break in Gaia Equity when worlds become connected or when a society could clone sentient beings that share the same thoughts.</p>
<p>By using net migration rate for the adjustment in those cases, loopholes of aggressive takeovers using cloned beings or by connecting to a big world as a small world are patched.</p>
<p>Since voluntary and mutually agreed migration is the basis of resource adjustment, it creates an incentive for those in control of each realm to be hospitable to their own people and visitors, spreading a competition of hospitality throughout the connected universe.</p>
<h3>3.8 Holistic Rubrics</h3>
<p>At Celebration rank, a society uses holistic rubrics to inspire and recognize efforts that upgrade the society in ethics, happiness, peace, and resilience.</p>
<h4> 3.8.1. Ethics</h4>
<p>Ethics is treated as continuous, never-truncated, like an irrational number.</p>
<p>Quest Society embodies a self-correcting, algorithmic process (Choice Democracy + Quest Credits) to maintain ethical infinite precision.</p>
<p>Quest Society has structured ethical decision-making:</p>
1) Oracle drafts plans with collateral impact analysis; 2) Citizens endorse plans voluntarily. 3) Minimum endorsement thresholds ensure proportionality and consent. 4) Tools (Clerics, Heralds, Alchemists) mitigate risk or collateral damage.</p>
<p>This prevents dogmatism or misjudgment of more nuanced ethical decisions.</p>
<h4> 3.8.2. Happiness</h4>
<p>Guilds are voluntary communities that organize quests and track contributions in a fun, collaborative way. They encourage creativity, recognition, and joyful participation, without enforcing rigid hierarchy</p>
Joining a guild isn't just for efficiency. It's about identity, theme, and shared adventure.</p>
Resource management apps already handle the "baseline" resource management and decision-making that a citizen wants to automate.</p>
<p>Magicians institutionalize joy and prevent quests from being "duties."</p>
<h4> 3.8.3. Peace</h4>
Disputes, whether over resources, guild rules, or cross-zone interactions, are resolved structurally: Bidding with Quest Credits (for resources in scarcity); Voluntary endorsement (plans, crises, Paladin interventions); Courts/archetypes clarify guild or zone rules when needed.</p>
<h4> 3.8.4. Resilience</h4>
Quest Society blends both long-term meaningful goals (building a "cathedral") and immediate joy (fun in laying each brick).</p>
This dual perspective also strengthens resilience: people stay engaged during stress because they enjoy the process, not just the outcome. </p>
<p>"fun as fuel" keeps society adaptable even in crises (people still quest joyfully under stress).</p>
<p>The Snap Test is a thought experiment to evaluate resilience by asking, "What happens if half of the population disappears randomly?</p>
<p>A society that is stable because its citizens are from the same culture and think alike is vulnerable if its system relies on that culture for its stability.</p>
<p>A systemically resilience society can handle immigrants who do not share the same culture.</p>
