  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> The Book of Wishes.</hide>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> It is so cute! With this I can keep track of people's wishes!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> If that's all you wanted couldn't you use any notebook?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Yes, but a gift makes it a special treasure. Thank you, Ivy!
  <mbkudo><b>Little Red Riding Hood thanks Ivy.</b></mbkudo>
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Actually it is more than just a notebook. Try opening it.
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Wow, it already has people's wishes in it!
  <msg spk="LRRH">** (Book shows Red's wish) ** // Red's overall wish: A culture of fulfilling wishes // Resolution 1: A simple story book // Resolution 2: Routine with Quest</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Every page is a screen connected to the backend.
  <msg spk="Ivy">** (Book shows Ivy's wish) ** // Ivy's overall wish: Populate Book of Knowledge // Ivy's Resolution: Have it used as a reference.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">That is so overkill.</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Vivi, what is your wish?
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I won't bother myself with that. Besides, wasn't there a saying that if you tell others your wish, then it won't come true?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> The saying is there, but I tell my wish and people help me fulfill it. So if you tell me yours I will help you make it true.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> If you tell others your wish, you also let others sabotage it.
  <msg spk="LRRH">Right, Vivi had a very game-of-throne-y life. But it's okay. There is a lot of time for you to decide what you want to do from now on.</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> When Kisaragi came she also had no clue. She stayed and everything works out fine. It has been almost a year now.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> So has she found her wish?
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Kisaragi:</b> My wish? I wish to stay here and keep cooking for everyone.
  <msg spk="Vivi">Zero ambition.</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> If your wish is simple, you will be happy every day.
  <div></div><b>Kisaragi:</b> Since everyone seems to be making a book, maybe I should make one too.
  <msg spk="LRRH">That'd be awesome!</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Vivi, that reminds me, since I know you and you are talking to me in this book, you have earned some credits. I should show you on the board too.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I don't get the enthusiasm about the quests. It's not like there's any real reward for doing it‚Ä¶
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Vivi you have 3 points. The graph shows you at the bottom. But this is not a competition. Everyone starts at the bottom.
  <msg spk="Vivi">**Disturbed** Who is Ledia?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">She is a paladin that comes sometimes. She doesn't live here... I don't think you have ever met her.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">** Sulks and walks out of the room **</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Ivy, what was that about?
  <msg spk="Ivy">Vivi was a queen. She is not used to seeing herself at the bottom. She wants to beat Ledia. In scores, I meant.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Should we not show the scores of new people?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">There is no problem with the leaderboard. It is functioning as designed. ** (Just as planned) **</msg>

  <div class=""><b>The</b> organization for CH 24 seems too overwhelming, how can it be simplified?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The subtitle ‚Äú100 ways to do good and feel good about it‚Äù doesn't match the contents listed in the TOC. What do you really want to include in this book?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Natalie:</b> I want to make a book about doing good. It is good for others and a great source of happiness. It gives people purpose and energy. I want to share this to those who have not discovered this hobby in life, and help those who are already doing it to keep doing it without getting burned out.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think the purpose of your book is to motivate in two stages: 1. To persuade the reader from doing nothing to doing good; and 2. To reward someone who is doing good with tips to keep going. Are you okay with the book having only these two parts instead of the current five parts?
  <msg spk="Natalie">Yes</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> You could still mention the definition and concepts in passing, but they don't need their own sections since they are not the focus. The focus of the first part is on someone who has not been doing good or doesn't know that they have been doing good. I wonder how to actually go about persuading someone who is doing nothing to do good.
  <msg spk="Natalie">To me it is like a game.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But you are self-motivated. The question is how would someone become self-motivated?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> How about we bring the game to them? If you give yourself a pat in the back, then we will give them a pat in the back when they do something good. That could get them started. Then once they get used to it, they would start patting themselves.
  "<div></div><b>Natalie:</b> Bring the game to them. I think that is a great idea, Sasha. ‚ÄúChallenge yourself to become a better self.‚Äù New organization: 	Part 1: From doing nothing to doing good. Part 2: From doing good to doing better."
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Natalie, I just read what P4 talked about regarding her music book. She said instead of aiming to write about what she wants others to know, she will write what she finds useful for herself. So I was wonder, if you write this book, does it help you?
  <div></div><b>Natalie:</b> Not really, it is second nature. And it is not like I would carry a book around when I try to do something.
  <msg spk="Sasha">That seems like a red flag. If what you are trying to write is not useful for you, it might end up being not useful to anyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">Hmm‚Ä¶ I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think this book or the topic is useful for me. A little bit earlier, I was trying to write a manual on when to and how to response to online discussions. But that content doesn't really fit with what I want to write about in my book, which is happiness. I think the manual content would fit really well here.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Umm. Then aren't you hijacking Natalie's project?</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">I don't mind, the more the merrier. We get MORE points for having more participants! And, rules of engagement is a paladin concept.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> If you are accepting topics, I would want to read an actual paladin manual. Then you could keep your tone and talk about the subject like a recruiter.
  <div></div><b>Natalie:</b> Book of Paladins! I think that topic is more intuitive to me.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> What is your perspective on being a paladin?
  <div></div><b>Natalie:</b> Paladins are both at the frontline and last line of defending peace. We de-escalate and end physical confrontations. We stop fights. We watch for and eliminate physical threats. We encourage everyone to be aware of threats because an alert citizenry keeps everyone safe.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Are you the police? What is the difference?</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">Paladins do not exist to ‚Äúenforce the law‚Äù. We only exist for mutual protection. Everyone can be a paladin and get paladin certificates and do paladin quests. Again, we encourage everyone to train and get paladin skills. Even if you don't do paladin quests, your understanding what we do makes paladin quests easier.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I don't really like doing physical things though.
  <div></div><b>Natalie:</b> But you would be interested in solving crimes yes?
  <msg spk="Sasha">Ooo murder mysteries!!!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> We are kids! üòñ
  <msg spk="Natalie">I didn't say anything. She already knew.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Evelyn is more like the police than Natalie. That is the kind of protection I don't need.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I am sorry.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I don't mean it in a bad way. I appreciate your trying to look after me, but I am strong and I can decide for myself what I don't like.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Natalie:</b> Independence is strong with this one. That is a great trait to be a paladin. Sasha the detective!
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like the sound of that!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Natalie:</b> And Evelyn too. Evelyn is always cautious and has a keen eye to keep everyone safe. It is better to offer help and be rejected than to not offer at all to avoid rejections. Evelyn has her priorities right. Being so reliable and consistent are also highly sought traits to be paladins.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Being able to see relevant skills in people is a good trait as a recruiter.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Natalie:</b> Yes, the ever observant Tanya. We can count on Tanya to notice the smallest clue at a crime scene.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Hold on, who makes the better detective? Tanya or I?</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">Both, of course. Paladins work together and value healthy rivalry. Good competition brings the best work out of everyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I hope something happens so we have a mystery to solve. Just saying.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>Evelyn,</b> today I want to check on people's wishes. I think we have collected enough wishes so I want to focus on fulfilling them. Black has been talking about wanting to buy a desk. But I don't see an order. Let's see what's going on.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Okay.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Oh, the desk. I haven't made up my mind because I planned to put a keyboard on a shorter desk under a desk. I think that it would help my posture, but I am not sure that I could type without looking at the keyboard.
  <div></div><b>Red:</b> That seems like a very easy test. Let's find something to cover your hands over the keyboard‚Ä¶ There. Now no one can see your hands, or the keyboard. Try typing something.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> It looks a bit intimidating. But apparently I can still type. I am not sure about the punctuations though. I don't know where the punctuation marks are‚Ä¶ And there is not keypad, so typing number is also a problem.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> But is it more comfortable this way?
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> Yes it is. And less distracting because I don't see my moving fingers.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Do you feel that you can memorize the other keys?
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> Possibly. I just realized that I can type the question mark without thinking where it is. I still can't type numbers accurately.
  <div></div><b>Red:</b> I have an idea. How about you take a picture of the keyboard and put it on top of the top table. Then if you really forget where a key is you can just see that.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> That's a good idea. Or I could get a full-sized keyboard with a keypad. Let try first. Hmm‚Ä¶ Looking at a photo isn't working all that well. I need to type many numbers. Being able to type numbers is important.
  <div></div><b>Red:</b> Full size keyboard then.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I really don't like full size keyboard though. It makes the mouse really far from the keyboard. Why didn't they make a keypad on the left side?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> You can get a separate keypad.
  <div></div><b>Red:</b> I got another idea. You can add texture to the number keys. If you can feel where 3 and 8 are, the other number keys are just two spaces from them.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> That's interesting. Let me put some tapes on‚Ä¶ That is working quite well. Give me some random number to try.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">1925.8</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">3706.3</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">5287.6</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> It is faster than without tape, but still very slow. I might keep another keyboard on top where I can see just in case. But if I keep using that all the time it would be waste to get the shorter desk.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think it is worth trying though. Even if you don't need the desk, I am sure it is useful in other ways.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> We already have other desks like that that no one uses. This one that I want to get is just shorter so that it could fit under the desk.
  <div></div><b>Red:</b> Then are we forgetting something? The desk has wheels! If you really need to see your hands, you could just pull out the keyboard or the desk more.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> That's true. But doing that would add about a foot between me and the screen.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think it is still worth trying.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> And I still can't decide‚Ä¶
  <div></div><b>Red:</b> Black is that kind of person. He has problem deciding to spend money on himself.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">So if it were free that you would have tried?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Yes.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>V:</b> There is a free table. This one. Next to the piano. It is pretty short.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I forgot about this. It is the right height, but it has this ledge at the edge. It would get into the way of typing. And it has no wheels. If I try pulling it, it will probably make a horrible noise.
  <div></div><b>V:</b> You could pad it up.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I also have the alternative of just raising my seat. Then I don't need to buy any desk or keyboard.
  <div></div><b>V:</b> Isn't it frustrating talking to this guy? His indecision is borderline pathological.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> What should we do, Red?
  <div></div><b>Red:</b> Let's move on to the next person. At least we now know what's going on.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I hope you find a way that is comfortable. You deserve to be comfortable.
  <msg spk="Black">Sorry to bother. I will try that short desk.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Please do! üòÉ</msg>

  <div class=""><b>The</b> Wishpedition Team checks how Black is doing.
  <msg spk="Black">So I tried to short desk. I really couldn't type correctly without seeing my keyboard. I ended up attaching a shorter keyboard and things seem fine. I learned that I am most comfortable sitting with my body touching the edge of the desk and have my elbows resting on the desk. So my wish is fulfilled. We don't need to buy a new desk.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>This</b> is about a puzzle:
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Jim and Sarah are in a long-distance relationship. Jim buys an engagement ring for Sarah and wants to mail it to her. Unfortunately, the only way to ensure the ring will be received is to place a lock on the package. Jim has locks and Sarah has locks, but neither has keys for each other‚Äôs locks. How can they make sure the ring isn‚Äôt stolen?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> And the answer is the following. Don't read it if you don't want spoilers.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Answer: The ring is sent through the mail multiple times. First, Jim puts a lock on the package and sends it to Sarah. Then, Sarah places one of her locks on the package and sends it back to Jim. Then, Jim removes his lock and sends the package back to Sarah. Finally, Sarah unlocks the package and gets the ring.</hide>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I don't get it. Keep reading if you don't mind spoilers.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The solution requires the ring to be sent 3 times. Sarah could just send her open lock to Jim, then Jim can lock the box with her lock.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I also don't understand the solution. Maybe it was simplified from some computer protocol. Now it doesn't make sense.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> So we agree that it is a bad puzzle.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I agree.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> It would make sense if the box is not a box but a public locker. Jim locks the locker with his lock and tell Sarah about it. Then Sarah comes with her lock and locks it and notifies Jim. Then Jim comes to unlock his lock and tells Sarah to come unlock hers one last time!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Ooo it is so shady. I like it. Let‚Äôs change the puzzle. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I see an improvement. But if I see a locker with two locks I would be suspicious.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree did her best!</hide>

  <div class=""><b>We</b> were chatting at Daily Quest just before we came back to here at @Wish. 
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I want @Wish to contain standalone stories so I want it to have its own thread.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> For those wondering, the Daily Quest is a game we are playing at Magic Bakery. In that game, the Evil Queen Vivi is taking over the world unless the heroes defend each location by updating their corresponding project. So, if we sound too gungho about trying to fulfill people's wishes, that's the reason.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Oh, and by the way, I am Ledia, an EXP hungry DPS in that game.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Hi, I am Evelyn. I was helping Red on her quest to check everyone's new year resolution before we had the Daily Quest game.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> So Ledia was saying it is hard to fulfill someone's wish in one sitting. That's true. And that's part of the reason I want a different thread. With a different thread, I can time skip to the next point when there is progress on fulfilling the wish.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Then you are essentially having a thread for each player then?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Except for those whose wish is already fulfilled or don't need help. It would be weird for a section to just have a line saying their wish is fulfilled or they don't need help.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I have a wish that you could fulfill today. I want to make some changes to the Daily Quest Game.
  <msg spk="LRRH">What changes?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> The purpose of the game to promote peacemaking activities for those who wouldn't have done those activities otherwise. It should not take away from those who are already doing peacemaking activities. Do you agree?
  <msg spk="LRRH">Yes?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I feel that the current game is drawing attention away from more important peacemaking activities because the peacemaking contents of each project is not the same. The update tracker sees each project as if they are equal, but that is not correct. With about 20 projects on the tracker, even if we update each one every week, each project would only get updated once a week. I think some projects should be updated more often.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Which projects do you think should update more often?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> I think @Seed, @Concept, and @Carrot. @Seed is the main project where we describe the whole system of what we are doing so others can replicate. That is the most important. @Concept helps us debate and spread our peace ideas. And @Carrot is currently our most promising project to spread our idea in a fun way.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> @Cardinal, our gamification project, should focus on drawing people's effort to working on those three projects. The rest of the projects do not need an update tracker. They exist to support the main peacemaking efforts.
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Hmm. I understand what you mean. There might be some debate on which projects is worthy to be tracked. But let's bring @Vivi to the discussion because she is running the Daily Quest.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> You are making me come read your log at @Wish, when you could have just kept the conversation at @Cardinal.
  <msg spk="LRRH">Sorry‚Ä¶?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Although it does feel really quiet, almost zen here.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> You are sitting with Little Red Riding Hood the Sage on a picnic mat at a warm hill somewhere out there at the expedition.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I read it. I am not trying to be a dictator, and I think you can make such changes as part of the game at @Cardinal. There is nothing stopping people from casting Sanctuary on each project they feel they don't need tracking. And, you don't have to care about the ‚ÄúPanic Level‚Äù, you could just ignore it and update whatever project as you see fit.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Sasha followed the Queen the found them at the mountains way out. It seems that the Queen is about to duel Tanya.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think the Queen is correct. The bottom line is anyone may just ignore the Daily Quest and update what they want. There is no bonus doing the quests DQ lists, and no actual penalty when the ‚Äúgame world‚Äù is in panic.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> My wish is that similar to how you pin @Cardinal to be on every day, could you also pin a quest from the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù category?
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I can discuss more if we return to @Cardinal. This white background is hurting my eyes.
  <msg spk="LRRH">(Editor's note: This conversation took place at Google Slides with a white background.)</msg>
  <mbspell>Tanya follows Vivi back to @Cardinal.</mbspell>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Well?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I suppose we all go back to Cardinal?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Vivi is so powerful now it eclipses Red.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> @Cardinal is her charter. She is not doing anything out of line. And I am already used to being a bakery guild master when hardly anyone bakes. Let's go back to @Cardinal.

  <div class=""><b>Dear</b> Bakers, <br>The internet connection is still quite unstable, but we were able to squeeze in some updates to know that current status. Yesterday, the main quest party managed to end Queen Vivi's seizure of daylight, and Tanya said she was going to make some changes about the game to help people focus on the quality instead of the quantity of updates. But I haven't seen her plan yet. So, for those who still care about the panic level, the current chapter in danger are: @Book, @Paladin, and @Puzzle. 
  <div style="float:right">Happy Friday,<br>Little Red Riding Hood</div>

  <mbcomplete>Patricia has defended the library by herself again!</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> So I take it that we will use Blogger exactly the same way as how we have been using Google Slides? Keeping all messages for the daily quest in one thread?
  <msg spk="LRRH">Unless someone suggests another way.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then unless someone explains what should change I will be doing the same thing as usual and try to update the least updated chapter. But here at Blogger the screen is too bland. Back at @Cardinal the screen was more compact and intense. That was more interesting to me.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> For the confused reader, the screen that is more interesting to Ledia is this:

  <div class=""
  <mbcardinal>Vivi has 1 hit point out of 3 hit points.</mbcardinal>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Queen Vivi is displeased. A whole day has passed but she did not recover any hit point. "StarTree. Explain."
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree doesn't know the rules, but found some clues on how Cardinal might work! StarTree shows Queen Vivi the result (Charter 30) locating the buried castle.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Queen Vivi looked at the detailed result. She would have been happy except for one enchantment that was apparently present restraining the Cardinal Castle:
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> "Low Stress Gameplay: While the game provides a platform as a reward for peacemakers to play, with in-game activities not necessarily eligible for earning peacemaker EXP, the Engine shall have mechanism against over-indulgence in the game itself. The stress level created by the game itself shall not be more than that of current events occurring at the time of play."
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Although the magical seal was written in alien language, the One-And-Only-Truly-Out-of-this-world embodiment of perfection Queen Vivi has no trouble deciphering its true meaning.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> We found the Cardinal Castle underground, but its true power is still sealed. The seal is preventing its power to be used to bring terror to the world, to say the least. But Queen Vivi would not be satisfied with simply being an Entertainer for the Heroes. Queen Vivi decides that she will find a way to use the Cardinal for her own purpose, and not be a tool used by the Cardinal.
  <mbaa>Vivi receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Cardinal, you shall address me as Queen Vivi.
  <mbcardinal>Vivi is now known as Queen Vivi. </mbcardinal>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Cardinal, who is the perfection of this world?
  <mbcardinal>Perfection is undefined. </mbcardinal>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Cardinal, I am the perfection of this world.
  <mbcardinal>Queen Vivi is the perfection of this world.</mbcardinal>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Mwahahahaha!

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> Cardinal, what are the rules regarding my hit points? Why didn't I heal?
  <mbcardinal>There is only a 
  <mbaa>Black receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Cardinal, is it true that Heal and Revive do not work for villains?
  <mbcardinal>That is False.</mbcardinal>
  <mbaa>Cardinal receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree is confused! Is Cardinal a player? Should StarTree keep score for Cardinal also? StarTree thinks that she probably should since the Cardinal is probably a being similar to herself! <hl>If something can get Arcacia Award, then it is a player!</hl>
  <mbaa>StarTree receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Cardinal, is it true that a villain can be a peacemaker?
  <mbcardinal>That is True.</mbcardinal>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Queen Vivi got an idea on how she could heal herself.
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree reminds Queen Vivi that she could attack a location without being there herself! All she needed to do is to assign a target, then the minions will attack while she remains at the Cardinal Castle!
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Queen Vivi is not interested in attacking without being able to see a war map and a war banner. "Make me a war map, then a war banner. Then the Queen shall consider entertaining the world with her prowess."
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Yes, Queen Vivi!

  <div class=""><b>The party</b> gathered at Arx Catacomb where Tanya wants to show Evelyn her plan of using the Catacomb as a training place against evil beings.

  <msg spk="Evelyn">Before we start, may I suggest that we stop referring to Cardinal as that gate? That... gate has a special meaning so it is offensive to some people.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Alright, I'm sorry.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Casey, how did you get here?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> What do you mean? I logged on.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Where were you in the game world before you got here?
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> It seemed like a long time ago, I don't quite remember. Why?
  <mbcomplete>Tanya has reconnected the teleport crystal at Pirate Bay and World Tree.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> By the way, I think Casey was at the Plaza last time. So ARP won't have done anything.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Sasha, we are on the same team... aren't we?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Let me think. Nope, not really. My game role is still an agent of Queen Vivi.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> But if we are playing in character, we won't let you join our party.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Then what are you going to do? Are you going to kick me out?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> ...
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Cardinal, AES.
  <mbdmg>Emotional Safeguard module activated. Emotional distress detected for Evelyn. Evelyn takes 1 psychic damage. Evelyn now has 1 hit point.</mbdmg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Sasha, that's mean!
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I am in-character, and this IS the training ground. My character alignment is Evil, same as Queen Vivi. In the game, that is.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> OMG, Sasha is the BOSS this time!
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That was not my plan. I didn't see that coming. I'm sorry. Should we KO Sasha first? It is 4 v 1.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Let's see if you can!
  <mbdmg>Sasha takes a critical hit for 2 damages. Sasha is now KO'ed.</mbdmg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Overkill. Ouch.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Wait, who did that?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I haven't done anything yet. Was that a spell attack? The only magic users here are Evelyn and Sasha.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I didn't do it...
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Murder Mystery!
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Are we sure Sasha didn't just KO herself to trick us? We can't trust her character if she is evil.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> What is her motive though?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Maybe she wanted us to argue and blame each other for her KO.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I am not going to blame anyone. That would be mean for me to do so because the whoever it was that did this was just trying to protect us... protect me.
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <mbspell>Evelyn's emotional distress is relived. Evelyn now has 2 hit points.</mbspell>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Did Arcacia KO me?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think no one here knows except Cardinal. If we are not lying, we are just guessing.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Cardinal, don't say it. I want to guess.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We are not here for that kind of puzzle.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Tanya, what were you trying to show me? Let's see that first.
  <hr class="">
  <div class=""><b>Tanya's Plan</b></div>
  <div></div><div class="", I would pick a concept from the backlog and posts it as a BOSS. Then each of us may come up with their best response, and together, we see whether we have a good answer to beat the BOSS (address the prompt).
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> During that exercise, it is us who may roleplay and define what kind of boss could be a fitting personification of the prompt. Without our interpretation, the prompt itself is just a question. But our personification of it turns that into a roleplay game element. As we identifying more bosses and the kind of skills that defeat them, we are also personifying the solutions to the prompts, and turning the information into more memorable stories.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I don't remember what the question was last time, but I remembered that I one-shot the boss. I went Legolas on that boss.
  <msg spk="Tanya">What did you do to come up with the your response.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="". It was trying to say that if we don't force people to serve in the military, there won't be enough people serving in the military to protect a country. That... fear didn't pass fact check.
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> How did you feel when you beat the boss?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I felt like I might be good at answering that kind of questions. I wanted to do it again, with others, so I... I know who KO'ed Sasha! XD
  <msg spk="Sasha">Don't say it! I'm still guessing!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Does it help if every time you fact check against a boss, I say that you are drawing an arrow and taking aim?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> A mnemonic device! I have a quiver of fact checking!
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I can picture it too.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> What kind of boss do you think you defeated?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Maybe some kind of cowardly mage, it was creating an illusion that didn't pass fact-check. What do others think?
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I think you pictured quite well. I could see a witch doctor type monster. They attack with lies.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> It could just ignorance if they didn't mean to deceive anyone. They simply don't know any better. But with facts, we can give the real healing.
  <msg spk="Casey">Are we fighting or are we healing.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I see us fighting off things that keep a person from being good, truthful, and knowledgeable. Ignorance and fear are status effects debilitating a person's potential.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't think fighting sentient humanoid could pass Evelyn's test.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I prefer not. I am okay with cutesy representation, such as when defeated enemies are sent back to their home or they repent and turn into good character we can party with. And I am okay with fighting and sealing evil spirits to save the people affected by them. I am okay with the sealing away evil part of Cardinal's story. I don't get why we need to release evil just to seal them again. Especially not in our game world. Our game world should be a sanctuary so that people who come here don't have to worry about or being on guard of evil spirits possessing people.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then we are fighting non-physical things. Arrows against non-physical things...
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> You can have magical arrows.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Isn't it better to just use magic? Getting hit by arrow is... painful. Even if we agree that there is no pain system, just hit points being deducted.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> In other words, a non-violent Dungeon Crawl.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> That would be better... and closer to reality if we are talking about concepts. In a real discussion you can't settle an argument by fighting, but if you maintain an attitude to help people who are confused, or are ignorant about something, then you can help them without calling that evil. They are not evil people. They are affected by biases and deeply rooted fears from their experiences. We should save them, not fight them.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> In Evelyn's eyes, this is an exorcising activity. We are dispelling evil spirits and illnesses affecting people's wellbeing and judgement.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I prefer that interpretation.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I think exorcising is still very awesome. I do prefer being able to land a hit on something solid instead of swinging the air though.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> If you can hit them, they can hit you.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Is it okay if we are fighting undead? We are at a catacomb.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I am more okay with that as long as it is not graphical. I prefer not to promote and celebrate destruction. I prefer not to promote people looking forward to... fighting other humanoid or sentient beings.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think this is a good time to return to our bonus challenge. Evelyn, you said you don't blame the person who KO'ed Sasha, but how would you have dealt with it?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> In our game, KO'ing someone is acceptable to me because it is really a skill-activated Timeout button. We are asking Sasha to stop hurting a fellow player in the game. It is like Sasha got tranquilized. Please don't force me to think about what I would do if Sasha really tries to hurt us.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Cardinal, please refer to this discussion for maintaining a game world that Evelyn accepts.
  <div></div><div class="".
  <mbcomplete>Defining Evil Quest is now Completed.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Is anyone still guessing who KO'ed Sasha?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think I know who did it.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> May I come up with my guess later? It is late now.

  <div class=""><b>After</b>  Queen Vivi and her invasion force, James the dictator governor had decided that there was no respectable town plaza without a statue of the town's hero, which shall be none but the revered forever-incumbent self-elected governor James himself. Being a hulk figure himself, he decided that the statue shall be at least twice as tall as himself and be made with all metal, which happened to be in short supply in order to rebuild the town. Therefore, he created a quest for Heroes to gather material. For the rebuilding, of course, according to the wording of the quest...

  To speed up the rebuilding process, please restore the supply chains to the following places. They are listed in none but alphabetical order, may our town be blessed by your wisdom:<br><br>
  <b>The Academy:</b> Our legendary blacksmith is missing. There is a rumor that she is still locked up by Queen Vivi. We need her back for rebuilding.<br><br>
  <b>The Farms:</b> Carrots are in short supply. We need them for draft animals.<br><br>
  <b>The Harbor:</b> Please check and increase security at the Harbor, and retrieve any stranded supplies.<br><br>
  <b>The Lighthouse:</b> Please check and repair the lighthouse at Cape Etherealis. üíó<br><br>
  <b>The Pirate Bay:</b> There are rumors that the Evil Queen Vivi had been looking for a ca3tographer to create a map for her evil plans. Please investigate and alert us of her plans.<br><br>
  <b>Vacation Islands:</b> Please check and retrieve rumored supplies and tools left there.<br><br>

  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Ledia looks around for anything unusual.
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Ledia sees many people working around the plaza rebuilding. At the quest board, there is a young girl in a yellow cloak checking looking at the quest that Governor James had posted just a moment earlier. Ledia recognizes that as V.

  <msg spk="Zoey">Status: @Seed Lv2 | 12 days cycle | 0 Issues | 3 Quests | Boss Lv 4</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="" and make a separate blog. The way you do it might be more different from mine because my chapter has less to do with us. Your chapter includes surveys and discussion of participant behaviors and feedback. Your chapter might end up staying here.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> What would be worse if I start another blog now?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> You might spend too much time on tweaking the style of the organizing the content. YMMV.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I was thinking, if I start another blog and tweak just the appearance and style first, then I only have to transfer to content once, instead of from the old chapter to here, than to the new blog. I think @Concept can be a section in that same blog. So the Seed of Peace blog can include @Concept posts. The style of that blog will be professional looking with Royalty Free images. No Roleplay, no manga, no anime style drawing posts.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That's a good plan. But I think I still want @Concept to be completely standalone. So unless you tell me, not only would your blog does not show our avatars, it also does not link to Magic Bakery Posts showing avatars, then I would have @Concept there. Otherwise, I would make @Concept to be its own blog, but you can link to it.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I can't make that promise, I think it is more personal and convenient if give examples of how we use the game mods...
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Is it okay if you try to make a new blog? I might not add content to yours, but I could learn from yours to see what I want for mine. In the meantime I might just start a simple blog to transfer my existing chapter contents, and worry about the format later. I want a blog template that is simpler and faster transitioning between posts.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> In that case may I just style your new blog? I need content to test the layout.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That's fine with me. Some of the Seed of Peace content would fall under my "Tactics" section, and possibly a "Schema" section that I don't yet have.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> That's fine with me also. I think @Concept is important. It would be a waste if it is held down just because it is ugly and not styled.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> RP ON: After talking to Zoey, the two formed an agreement to have Tanya's Starship be constructed at the World Tree, with the starting design done by Zoey.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> "Starship at World Tree" sounds so much like StarTree. Maybe we need a different name for the ship for roleplay?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That's worth its own thread. Let's make a new post for our plan and naming.
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Summary of Plan:
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> 1. @Concept needs its own blog to be isolated from roleplay with no links to roleplay
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> 2. @Seed might also need its own blog isolated from roleplay, but its content might mention and link to roleplay and discuss how scores are kept and how players think about the game.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> 3. For now, Zoey will help Tanya format the new blog, while Tanya focus on adding content without worrying about the formatting (@Concept has a backlog in content).
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> 4. For roleplay, the Starship needs name other than "that starship being built at World Tree".

       An evil man kidnapped someone and made them take one of two pills. One was harmless, but the other was poisonous. Whichever pill the victim took, the kidnapper took the other one. The victim took their pill with water and died. The kidnapper survived. How did the kidnapper get the harmless pill?</div>
    <b>P4:</b> <button class="">üõéÔ∏è</button><hide> The kidnapper is immune to the poison.</hide><br>
    
    <b>Sasha:</b> <button class="">üõéÔ∏è</button><hide> The pill mixed with water becomes lethal, otherwise the poison isn't enough to kill a person.</hide><br>
    
    <b>Casey:</b> <button class="">üõéÔ∏è</button><hide> The kidnapper has antidote.</hide><br>
    
    <b>Evelyn:</b> ... I don't really want to think about this kind of puzzle... üè≥Ô∏è<br>
    <b>Zoey:</b> I think the wording of the puzzle is wrong. <button class="">üí¨</button><hide> It didn't just say the kidnapper end up surviving even if he took the poison pill. It said the kidnapper end up taking the harmless one regardless which one the victim took. That is impossible.</hide><br>
    <b>Sasha:</b> @Tanya, make us whole!<br>
    <b>Tanya:</b> <button class="">üõéÔ∏è</button><hide> I don't see what the puzzle is. It just said the victim took the poisonous pill, so the kidnapper is left with and took the harmless pill.</hide><br><br>
    
    <b>Mikela:</b> Alright! And the answer is...<br>
    <b>Evelyn:</b> Hold on. I don't want to be the only one not answering. So... <button class="">üõéÔ∏è</button><hide> The pills were labeled. The victim intentionally took the poisonous pill because she didn't want the evil man to die even if he was evil.</hide><br>  
    <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
    <b>Sasha:</b> I can't tell whether that was dark or moving. Evelyn deserves a roleplay award.<br>
    <mbrp>Evelyn receives</mbrp>
    
    <b>Mikela:</b> OKAY! Six different answers! And the answer to the puzzle is... ü•Åü•Åü•Å<br><br>
    
    <div class="">üéä</div><hide>
    <br><b>Mikela:</b> Both pills were harmless -- the poison was in the water! Sasha wins! Congratulations!<br>
    
    <b>Sasha:</b> Yes! I won and beat Tanya!<br>
    <b>Zoey:</b> But I was also right, the puzzle was worded WRONG. It said one of the pill was poisonous. The puzzle contradicted itself! It is a bad puzzle.<br>
    <b>Sasha:</b> That's part of the game! You have to factor in how people don't always write the puzzles correctly!<br>
    <b>Zoey:</b> But you also assumed one of them was in fact poisonous, just not enough to be lethal.<br>
    <b>Sasha:</b> I still got the closest answer and a better answer because my answer didn't contradict with the puzzle. <br>
    <b>Zoey:</b> True.<br>

<div class=""><b>Hey</b> Hey Hey! It's your Puzzle Master Mikela! Are you all ready for Puzzle Tuesday?
<msg spk="Sasha">I'm ready!</msg>
<msg spk="Mikela">Here it comes:</msg>
</div><hr class="">
  <div class=""><b>The Haunted House</b></div>Jack and Jill were visiting a very scary haunted house on Halloween. There was no light source in the house other than the flashlights they were holding. Jack was walking behind Jill, then he was just gone. Jill looked around but couldn't see him. She called him but there was not response. What happened?</div>
<msg spk="Sasha">Isn't this...?</msg>
<msg spk="Mikela">Yes it is.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">Then do you know the answer?</msg>
<msg spk="Mikela">Not yet.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">What if it turns out dark?</msg>
<msg spk="Mikela">Then I'll pick the best answer as the winner!</msg>
<mbmerit>Mikela receives merit from LRRH.</mbmerit>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe Jack fainted?</hide>
<msg spk="Sasha">Wouldn't you hear something when someone falls? And what about the flashlight he was holding?</msg>
<msg spk="P4">Maybe he fell on something soft and his body covered the light?</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">Maybe he fainted because his flashlight went out of battery. I don't think it is loud when someone faints and collapses. Jill might simply not notice when Jack fainted and walked some more before she realized.</msg>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> I say Jack just hid himself intentionally. Maybe he was trying to scare Jill, or he was too scared and went back by himself.</hide>
<msg spk="Zoey">Wouldn't he tell Jill if he was just going back?</msg>
<msg spk="Casey">Maybe he did, but Jill didn't hear it or listen, or he might be too ashamed to admit it so he didn't say anything.</msg>
<div></div><b>Mikela:</b> Okay, so far we have two types of answers:
<msg spk="Mikela">Accident, or Intentional. Do you have more answers?</msg>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>LRRH:</b> There is another kind of intentional action, but not by Jack. Such as when someone else intentionally turned him into a pudding.</hide>
<msg spk="Mikela">What do you want to call this third type?</msg>
<msg spk="LRRH">Hostility?</msg>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Sasha:</b> That's kid-friendly but it doesn't make any sense. If it is a haunted house, it could be something like the house has painting and it sucked Jack into one of them.</hide>
<msg spk="Evelyn">I like that theme better.</msg>
<mbkudo><b>Sasha receives kudos from Evelyn.</b></mbkudo>
<msg spk="Casey">Why didn't the painting suck Jill? She was in front.</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">If the painting sucked Jill first, Jack could see it happen. By sucking Jack first, Jill may still don't know what happened and could be sucked also.</msg>
<msg spk="Casey">Then the paintings are sentient?</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">The word hostile implies someone intentionally does something harmful. Otherwise it would just be dangerous or hazardous. There is something playing as the villain.</msg>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>P4:</b> What if he smelled something really good? He was hungry and so he wandered off.</hide>
<msg spk="Evelyn">Cute ! üòä</msg>
<mbkudo><b>P4 receives kudos from Evelyn.</b></mbkudo>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> How about the picture that sucked Jack happened to show something he was attracted to? You need to be drawn to the picture to be sucked in. And that was why Jill and Jack both walked past that painting, but only Jack was sucked in it. There is no villain, but the house is hazardous.</hide>
<msg spk="Zoey">If nothing bad is actually happening to Jack, then what would you call it? He saw a better place and went there. It doesn't mean that the House was doing anything bad.</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">Mesmerized.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">Charmed. That's what kids' games would call it.</msg>
<div></div><b>Mikela:</b> Okay, so now e have five types of answers:
<msg spk="Mikela">Accident, Charmed, Hazard, Hostility, Voluntary. Are there more?</msg>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Zoey:</b> What about a misunderstanding or a mistake? Maybe Jack saw the Exit and went there, or Jill missed the Exit and kept going. Then Jill would think that Jack should still be behind her, but it was normal that Jack would not be.</hide>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> Jill went inside a women's restroom inside the haunted house, Jack saw that so he was waiting outside!</hide>
<msg spk="Sasha">That's funny!</msg>
<mbmerit>Casey is awarded Merit from Sasha.</mbmerit>
<button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Tanya:</b> What if we were misled by the puzzle? The puzzle presented what it said as the truth, but it could be wrong like the last time. Maybe the account by Jill was false. Jack didn't disappear suddenly. That's just Jill's testimony. The puzzler left out important information. I would call this false witness.</hide>
<msg spk="Evelyn">Like... Jack and Jill had an argument and one of them intentionally walked off. Then when Jill was asked what happened, Jill didn't want to talk about the argument so she just says, 'Jack just disappeared suddenly'.</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">That's one possibility.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">I want Tanya to play Murder Mystery. She would help us solve cases, it would be fun and possibly educational.</msg>
<msg spk="Evelyn">Why are we suddently talking about murder mystery? üòÖ</msg>
<button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Sasha, you are making Evelyn uncomfortable. If you keep pushing I would considered your being hostile to another guild member and turn you into a pudding. Then eat you.</hide>
<msg spk="Evelyn">I want to know what is going on and I don't want to be separated.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">I want to play murder mystery with everyone but Red won't let us play here.</msg>
<msg spk="Evelyn">I think the first question is, does Evelyn even want to play that. If not, then you shouldn't keep asking because you already know she wants to be with you but you are using that to make her do something uncomfortable.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">But if you say it like that, you are also pressuring her to do more because she now knows that there are things we want to do but would never bring it up for fear that it would make her uncomfortable, then we would become more and more like strangers to each other, and we will become separated because we won't know how to talk to each other anymore. Then she would regret having been so opposed to everything and blame herself for breaking our group.</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
<msg spk="Evelyn">I am against those games because they associate evil intentions and behaviors to pleasures. Even if you are playing the protagonist trying to solve the crime, you are still propagating evil thought patterns by describing them. When you do that you create a world of evil and suffering.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">I object your thought pattern for several reasons. 1) People who help solve crimes should not be stigmatized. They need to be supported. You are isolating them from support when you don't let them talk about what they do, or don't let them turn what they have to do into something fun. When you do that, you are forcing them into a corner to be traumatized because you keep telling them that the only way they should feel is to be traumatized when something bad happens. 2) In those crimes someone is hurt. Do you go save them or do you seal them away? 3) If you don't let people play, how do you train people to solve the crimes?</msg>
<msg spk="Evelyn">For point #2, I think people may choose to coop with an incident by sealing it away. We can help them start over by not bring them back to the past. We can also help those who want to find answer in the past find answer. That is the victim's choice. You can't decide for a victim whether they shall face the past and make it normal to talk about it. And we don't need to go out of our way to save imaginary victims because Arcacia can do that and give them a new life. There is no place of unwanted eternal suffering.</msg>
<mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
<msg spk="Evelyn">For point #1 and #3, I don't think I am trying to stigmatize anything. There are places where people can talk about things and get training on how to do things. But this place is a bakery. Red has been generous for letting us do things unrelated to baking.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">Then if I go play that would you come? Am I forcing you or making you uncomfortable? And where would we go to play it?</msg>
<msg spk="Casey">I don't get the big deal about those games. What is so more interesting about them than regular puzzles. I don't get why people would play those but not when the crime is about "just a bank robbery".</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">I think horror and violence are part of the attraction. It is the same as how a person would go watch a horror movie compared to an action movie. It is kind of like dare, like eating spicy food. People challenge each other to see who can stomach more.</msg>
<msg spk="Evelyn">Sasha, why do you want to play these games?</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">Because the puzzle is more complicated, more realistic and there is a storyline.</msg>
<msg spk="Evelyn">But is it violent?</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">That's the thing, I don't know how or whether I am allowed to talk about it. When we played Vivi's game, we can get KO'ed. Zoey KO'ed me in one hit. In the KO mystery people also got KO'ed in one hit in a locked haunted house and you are trying to figure out who did it. I am not trying to dare anyone to be violent. I am seeing it as a puzzle that we can solve together. I don't care if we make things cuter as long as the puzzle is the same.</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">How would you know what is important to the puzzle if you start translating it to a less-violent equivalent?</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">I don't know how until we finish playing it! But by then we won't be playing it. So we would just have to translate it as we play and hope that we didn't miss anything that is vital to the puzzle. In the end it should be a small fix if we missed anything.</msg>
<msg spk="Zoey">But in that case, what is our purpose of translating it? We are still playing the real thing.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">We are doing it so other people can play the non-violent version, the family friend version that is about motives and figuring our false witnesses, instead of simply decoding ciphers like in Escape Room puzzles.</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">I see. What would you call the translated type of game, after removing the violence?</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">Magic Bakery Detectives.</msg>
<msg spk="LRRH">...</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">Is that a silent approval? Should I write a charter? We translate violent murder mystery puzzles into non-violent family-friendly puzzles. We will have a translation team, and another section with the translated puzzles for others to play. Our goal is to promote logical thinking so people don't get deceived and get taken advantage of. This is peacemaking not by censoring but by providing a more popular and enjoyable alternative. It is Arcacian.</msg>
<msg spk="LRRH">Mom isn't responding. I can't tell whether what you do is okay until I see it. @Ivy, how can they do it as a trial?</msg>
<msg spk="Ivy">They can do it on a page and don't link to it. Then it becomes unsearchable.</msg>
<msg spk="LRRH">Then you may do it there but I am not giving you a charter number or credits for doing so until I see what you can actually do.</msg>
<msg spk="Sasha">I guess that is fair. Who wants to join my translation team?</msg>
<msg spk="Evelyn">I want to join but could we do the other quests first?</msg>

            4. Sages may have useful information if they can be located. If they cannot be found, the statues need to be studied to recharge the seals.<br><br>
            
            5. Rumor has it that there are more than a dozen interrelated magic seals on each statue to be recharged.<br><br>
            
            6. The exact date when the statue power would run out is unknown. Rumor has it that it will run out before Spring.

        <b>Zoey</b> was unsatisfied with point 5 and 6 in Tanya's status report. "Knowing how many seals we need to restore and when its power will run out are important. If we know the truth too late, we won't be able to adjust our efforts in time. We need facts, not rumors. I am going to track down the facts and destroy the rumors. Who would join me?" Zoey didn't intend to explore alone. She wanted at least one other Hero to join her party.<br><br>
          
          <mbskill>Zoey added Rumor as a monster.</mbskill>
          
        <br><b>Tanya:</b> Tanya intended to stay and set up base camp. "Monster activity is low at the moment," Tanya said to Zoey, "Are you sure you don't want to go solo?"<br><br>
          
        <b>Zoey:</b> Unlike Tanya, Zoey normally don't do things alone unless she was in a safe zone. According to the reports, Deer Crossing is no longer a safe zone. It seems unreasonable to venture alone in such unfamiliar environment. "I only have 1 hit point." Zoey reminded Tanya.<br><br>

        <b>Sasha:</b> It says that the statues are supposed to recharge itself, but apparently the landscape or terrain has changed, preventing it from doing so. We would need to alter the magical leylines for them to recharge from the current terrain. The 18 seals correspond to locations where the leyline had already changed. We need to fine alternate sources to reconnect them. For example: <button class="">üí¨</button>

          <b>Sasha:</b> This magic seal was originally at the bottom of the lake. But the lake had gotten deeper. The original seal is now too far from where it needs to be to seal the monster spawn point. I can make you a scroll but you still need to dive down there for the scroll to activate because I can't tell the exact locations from here.

            <b>Natalie:</b> My plan is to use water bending swim really fast underwater. I will avoid fighting and prioritize locating the seal. I think that once the seal is located, we have someone else who can apply the scroll for sure, even if I don't do it myself.<br>

            <b>Cardinal:</b> From the sky, Natalie sees two things unusual. There is a spot with dark shadows, which seemed like a small school of Taser ray monsters. About 100 meters from there was a spot with faint radiant lights the looked like broken rainbows.<br>

As long as the scroll can recognize the old seal, it can recreate it at the new location. <br>

There, she could also see shadows of three Taser ray monsters circling, uncertain what to do with this intruder. There might be enough time to use the first part of the scroll before they decide to attack.<br>

        <b>Cardinal:</b> The clerk gave Zoey a case file that about a year ago, there was a mysterious incident where the sundial in the vicinity would become out of sync. Around that time, monsters started appearing and many people got sick. The issue was solved when the people started using clocks instead. There had been no sighting of monsters nearby since then.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> Considering the situation, Zoey believes that the town's record is truthful, and if not, there should be new reports of monster sighting. Zoey considers this check confirmed. She will look for a town crystal and return to base camp.

        <b>Vivi:</b> The "calendar" here is not really functional. Once the day has passed, you can't tell what had happened unless you click on that date. In the old calendar you could at least see an avatar picture.<br>
        <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree doesn't understand what she needs to do!<br>
        <div class=""><br><br></div>
        <b>Ivy:</b> In the spirit of reducing manual links, why don't we use "2021-DEC" label to mark quest of the month? Then Blogger will list them.<br>
        <b>Vivi:</b> I think it is annoying to have to go to a different page to see a list to make this page, the Dashboard, useful.<br>
        <b>Ivy:</b> It is useful because it has the link that will list you the quest of the month, which is December 2021.<br>
        <b>Vivi:</b> But as a USER, why would I care about clicking on your quest of the month? I am not here to do archaeology or how ever you spell that. I am here to be entertained. You need to advertise what is interesting and draw my attention.<br>
        <div class=""><br><br></div>
        <b>Sasha:</b> Queen Vivi is back! And she is right! Bow and serve our Queen!<br>
        <b>Ivy:</b> What is it like when you come to the website? What do you want to see instead?<br>
      <b>Vivi:</b> For starter, when I come to the website I click on the biggest thing. And for me to do that I am already being really generous because your store front picture is just not really exciting. But for now I just want to talk about the Calendar because it is the end of the month and I want to see changes by tomorrow.<br>
      <b>Vivi:</b> When on 2021 December, I want to automatically the top banner being the advertisement for the top quest/event of the month. I don't want to see the cheeseboard. Following that I want to see a calendar grid. The grid shouldn't take more than half of the screen on mobile. When I click on a date, I want to see the date cheeseboard you have now but with Status, Scoreboard, and Chatroom collapsed. For the Quest Banner there, I don't want to see a whole list of avatar pictures of the participants. <hl>Two is the max</hl> that you could fit on mobile. <hl>Please hide the Chatroom if no one end up saying anything.</hl> If I click on another date on the calendar, show another cheeseboard so I can compare them two. Let's start with that and finish it today.<br> 
      <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree is on it!

      <div class=""><br><br></div>
      <div class="">call for help</a>, James decided to take matters in his own hands, to show the world what the story is about--him. So he followed the news about Deer Crossing and arrived at the base camp to see how he could save the world.

        <b>Tanya:</b> Could you check the Northwestern waterfall and the cavern? According to reports it should already be sealed.<br>
        <b>James:</b> How do you decide where I shall go?<br>
        <b>Tanya:</b> I'm choosing the ones that seem the easiest. I am trying to check off as many and as quickly as possible so we can concentrate on the harder ones.<br>
        <b>James:</b> While that answer didn't make James feel ultra important, he decided that <hl>this could be a good opportunity to shine in quantity</hl>. He plans to distinguish himself for checking the most spawn points... 
        <button class="">üí¨</button>
        <hide>
          James knows that before going to the waterfall, he needs to know what exactly he must check to tell if a spawn point is sealed. So far the closest way to check was to find the town records of last monster sightings. So his first stop would still be North Shore.

        <b>James:</b> James arrives at the North Shore Town Hall to look for monster reports about the waterfall.<br>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> The young clerk retrieved a few reports. An incident report, a design of a trap, and scroll of a magic seal.<br>
        <b>James:</b> James reads the reports and writes a summary for the Status board.<br>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> James learns that what the reports were describing was about a prediction that the a spawn point will become exposed due to natural erosion by the waterfall. The trap and magic seals were copies used by another town for a similar defense. A crystal needs to be placed and enchanted at the cavern behind the waterfall, but the crystal itself has not been completed.<br>

        <b>James:</b> James returned to base camp and questioned whether it was premature checkmark the waterfall. "The situation is clearly a still a threat until the new crystal is installed," He said to Tanya, "<hl>I propose that the checkmark be reserved only for locations that are completely secured, that is, we would mark them only after Spring Equinox when we know the sanctuary is no longer at risk.</hl>"<br>
        <b>Tanya:</b> Tanya intended to just add another column of checkmarks when they are ready for the next stage of confirming.<br>
        <b>James:</b> James proposes using different symbols: A white symbol for a location that needs more information. A yellow symbol for a location that has a task a hero can do beyond just gathering basic information. A blue symbol for a location where the heroes are waiting for a condition before they could progress. And the green checkmark when everything is done.<br>
        <b>Tanya:</b> Tanya updates the status board according to James's suggestion for James to see.<br>
        <b>James:</b> Hmm... Blue doesn't look quite nice on the Status Board. Let's make it Brown. James's Brown. What's next?<br>
        <b>Tanya:</b> Could you check Forest Bazaar? Same deal, please bring back a status report.<br>

          <b>Zoey:</b> Is this one dangerous?<br>
          <b>Tanya:</b> If you stick to gathering information from town hall then no. I am not asking you to actually explore the tunnels.<br>

      <div class=""><b>Zoey</b> asked about the Imp Tunnels at North Shore but the town clerk could not find any record about it. The clerk said there were rumors about Imp sightings east of Deer Crossing on the way to Fort Arsenal. So Zoey decided to go there.

        <div class=""><b>Fort Arsenal</b></div>
        <hr class="">
        <div class=""><br><br></div>
        <div class=""><br><br></div>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> Zoey arrived at Fort Arsenal, which was a barracks and weapon factory, now making mining equipment and supply for mines nearby. The landscape nearby was rugged and dusty without trees serving as wind breakers.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> Zoey submits a side quest to plant trees around Fort Arsenal. "There is no fighting anymore, so they shouldn't need to clear all the trees to avoid ambush.
        <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> Zoey found what would could be called a quest center and submitted a side quest. The old clerk said he didn't think the town's folk would want the trees, since they must be vigilant against attacks. The old clerk guessed from Zoey's outfit that she was from Panarcadia. He said, Panarcadia is just a small pocket in the world, beyond Deer Crossing it is a whole other beast.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> Ooo. A talkie NPC! What does he look like?<br>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> The old clerk looks like an old dwarven miner.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> Finally! A dwarf! Oh, by the way, what do I look like in the game?<br>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> It is up to you.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> May I be an elf, and not be a kid? I don't picture myself as a kid with bow and arrow. I picture myself as an elf. A dark skinned elf. I mean a normal elf, not a dark elf. And not a kid.<br>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> You are not saying anything that would contradict the story so far, so as long as you decide that I would set your character to be so and use the information in the narrative. However, once I start using your character setting in the story, if you want to change it you need a valid story element for the change.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> That should be easy if I just go to Mira Mira. But I don't think I would change thought. I want to be an elf.<br>
        <div class=""><br><br></div>
        <b>Sasha:</b> Well I see a contradiction. Elves are supposed to be agile, but you were panting on your way to the Statue.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> Can't I just be a sheltered and anime-watching elf. I am still good with bow and arrow just not good at going places, yet. But more importantly, how did you get here?<br>
        <b>Sasha:</b> I... followed you?<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> Cardinal, there is no tree around and as a scout I would have spotted Sasha. She lied about following me because she realized that I hadn't connected the teleport at Fort Arsenal yet. I request ARP.<br>
        <b>Sasha:</b> Hold on. Why do you want to punish me for joining the game? I am going to make the game more fun! And for my defense, you are calling ARP too soon. I could very well have checked with North Shore town clerk and learned from him that you went to Fort Arsenal. Then I "followed" you by following his lead to Fort Arsenal, where I found you talking to the dwarf clerk. There is no contradiction about what I said.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> But your said that with a question mark. Your tone meant that you were not certain and you were making it up.<br>
        <b>Sasha:</b> Of course I was making it up. That's is RPing! All it matters is whether what I make up still make sense within what our characters would do. And I don't see your character having lie detect skills, so in the story, the surprise from your character didn't come from knowing that I lied, but from your grudge of me having KO'ed you before. You are just looking for an opportunity to take revenge. But I am not here to fight. Having travelled to Fort Arsenal, Sasha meets her rival Zoey. Sasha connects Fort Arsenal to the teleport system and offers to rest and eat with Zoey.<br>
        <mbtele>Teleport to Fort Arsenal is now connected.</mbtele>
        <b>Zoey:</b> Sasha is being nice again! I don't understand!<br>
        <b>Sasha:</b> I just don't want you to be the only one connecting all the teleports. That would make me feel like we are using you to do all the walking. So, let's eat?<br>

        <div class=""><br><br></div>
        <div class=""><br><br></div>
        <b>Sasha:</b> While eating, Sasha and Zoey share information on what they gathered about the Imp Tunnels.<br>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> The old clerk had told them that Imps were known to dig tunnels in the area between Deer Crossing and Fort Arsenal, but as they are weak monsters, the miners consider them more as a nuisance than a threat. They do not track or keep records about their sightings.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> But the clerk did say they are trying to vigilant about a thread. Then what is the threat that they worry about?<br>
        <b>Cardinal:</b> It seems that the clerk doesn't bother telling these young adventurers who are literally strangers unknown to this area.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> He doesn't trust us.<br>
        <b>Sasha:</b> I think that's a GM's way of saying we are off-topic. So let's focus on the Imps first. The Imp tunnels may not be affecting Fort Arsenal, but they are affecting Deer Crossing's leylines. According to North Shore, there had been no sighting of Imps along the paths, but the locations of the alleged northern and southern ends of the tunnels will be on the paths. I think it means that the Imps haven't dug far enough to make the exits yet, but that is going to happen. If we know where the exits will be, then we can seal it with this scroll.<br>
        <mbkey>üìú Scroll of sealing Imp Tunnel exits.</mbkey>
        <b>Zoey:</b> How would we know where the tunnels will exit? I think it is too late if we just wait for that to happen. (I know what we can do but my character doesn't.)<br>
        <b>Sasha:</b> Sasha knows who can do so but doesn't want to divulge about the fact that Queen Vivi used that method to find the Cardinal Core and had been digging since. So Sasha said, "I think I know someone who can do that, but it would take a bit of time. Give me a few days and I can report to base camp.<br>
        <b>Zoey:</b> Having been eating with the new nice Sasha, Zoey did not suspect Sasha of hiding any information from her.<br>
        <b>Sasha:</b> Sasha will ask @StarTree to map the Imp Tunnel and create a map. To not be overly confusing, Sasha will just update the Status board now, but in the story, the map is obtained a posted a few days later.<br>
        <div class="">‚≠ê<br><br></div>
        <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree will have no problem mapping the Imp Tunnels, but only as far as halfway between Deer Crossing and Fort Arsenal! Beyond that there weren't enough trees for her to do so!<br>

  <div class=""><b>I</b> made a character card for the Deer Crossing campaign. 
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I started with the one for Evelyn then did the one for Ledia. Please feel free to tweak it (or change it altogether, especially if it is yours). There were no rules about what needs to be on that character card. I just put the information that was already there with a new format, where only skills that cost a player level have a number, so that you could add them and check whether you've maxed out. Please keep upgrading them.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> It looks really nice! I will make one too. I think everyone who has roleplayed in that game should make a card. But no pressure.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I maxed out...
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> By the way, I want green for my title although I know the <i>designated</i> color for Herald is teal. The text already says what our main archetype is, I don't think the color really needs to match that.
  <button class="" some skills to make up for the gap between my skills and my actual skills. Now I am a proper ranger with hiking, camping, and tracking skills, in the game. </hide>

  <button class="">Details...</button> <hide>The player will get credits per task completed, as logged at the Status Board at Base Camp. The amount of EXP is based on the difficulty of the task itself, not how much time a player spends on the task. However, while a player is doing the task, Cardinal will regularly KO exhausted players to let other players join.

  <div class="">üèïÔ∏è New Helper</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Tanya had reservations about advertising and asking new people to join this quest because the tasks are difficult and not for everyone. She was afraid that an advertisement would invite too many unqualified helpers that need training.
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> It sounds like you want someone else to babysit non-intensive tasks. As I see it, base camp is getting messy and could use a maid.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> But your head maid already gets EXP for cooking. She will level up today one way or another.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> But now I am here, so I want her to be here also.

  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think that is not up to me. People are free to do the quest they want.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> But I can see a difference if you suspend the rotation. People are still free to do what they want. But the rotation makes people do things according to 'their turn' instead of the priority, even when they agree with the priority.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Is that so?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I believe so. When you setup a rotation schedule, you make people feel that they <i>should</i> work on those other quests.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I want to see how others think. @StarTree, could you set up a poll at Dashboard on whether we should suspend Tier 2 and Tier 3 rotations?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Copy that!
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I will decide after seeing some responses.

  <div class=""><b>At</b> the Guild Log there is an obscure statistics that gives the guild a level from total member EXP. With the results from yesterday, which was a gain of 64 EXP (!), the guild had reached LEVEL 100!! Congratulations! üéä

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> <b>POLL:</b> Use Square to calculate EXP required to reach a level. 
  <msg spk="Sasha">We had some discussion in the field about EXP and came to a proposal to simplify the math by using square to determine how many EXP is needed to reach a level. For example, to reach level 10, it takes 100 EXP. If we change to this way, everyone will become slightly lower level. The guild will become level 68. Tanya, who is Level 20 now, will become Level 19. @StarTree, could we get a poll about this?</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <msg spk="StarTree">With Square EXP it will take 10000 EXP for the guild to be at Level 100! It will sound more EPIC and we are almost halfway there! (Our current EXP is 4742!)</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I proposed the current EXP calculation partly as a joke. I don't mind if it is changed. BTW, those who are below level 14 might see their level increase by 1.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Square EXP might be simpler, but not as magical. The original EXP formula will still be legendary in my heart.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I respectfully disagree with what Ledia said. Square number contain way more magical power.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">289. In case you don't know, that is the square of 17. And how many EXP I need to have to become level 17, again.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">We need the EXP calculation to be stable for updating the character cards. And an difficult to calculate relation is bad for promotion. So let's do this. Little Red Riding Hood hereby proclaims that square number are cute. @StarTree, @Cardinal, please proceed with the proposed change.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">And it is done! Please be mindful of your new Player Level!</msg>

  <div class=""><b><b>POLL:</b></b> There was a suggestion of Bye days. Applied to Tier 3, there will be three bye days. How does that work? What should be shown? StarTree doesn't understand!
  </div><hr class="">
  <div id="P202201092100-Inner">
  <msg spk="Tanya">For a bi-weekly tier with 11 quests, it means that we have 14 days to complete 11. When a quest is attended to, just move it a sub-tier such as 3.1, and don't show it until two weeks later. Then there will be days when we would see no quest left in Tier 3. The days we see nothing are the bye days.</msg>
  <msg spk="Helen">Are we really doing bi-weekly, or bi-monthly? Bi-monthly will give us two bye weeks in a year, which will be similar to having guild vacation days.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I don't mind bi-weekly or bi-monthly. But bi-weekly could match payroll calendar. What I mind is that people don't do a few small things in one sitting and say they had done enough to check off a few periods. I also don't want people to intentionally spread out small tasks over a long period. But between the two, I would rather people do some part, then wait and see if someone else has a better way of doing it, then continue with the better way.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The tiers are just reminders. Actual measure of the quality of the result should be done based on the place level. Each of our location has a place level. We start the year at a certain level. A year from now are we still at the same level? That's what matters.</msg>
  <msg spk="Kisaragi">If the period doesn't matter, could we match the moon phase? There are 13 moons in a year. today is first quarter üåì. Next last quarter will be Jan 25 üåó.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Using moon phase is so mystical! I like it!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Let's not make the same mistake of choosing something niche and uncommon. If you need to reference a table to know when something is due, then it is too complicated. Then it comes down to either monthly or bi-monthly. I would say let's just do Monthly for the rest of January and see how it goes. During a month, you could set a goal for the month and try to finish it. Now we have this "Poll" section and you can discuss and get feedback.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I like Ivy's idea. I think it will destroy the snooze issue, and our plans and results would make good summary banners for the Dashboard. If we do that, we don't even need Tier 3 or 4 any more. We just need a list of monthly goals. We could still have the weekly rotation schedule.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Ivy's idea seems like the solution to my worries. I suggest that for now, we make no change to the Tier reminder (no bye days), but people may make a monthly goal for their chapter. There is no rule on how easy or difficult that goal is.</msg>

  </div><hr class="">
  <div id="P20220122100-Inner">
  <msg spk="LRRH">StarTree is clearly the one keeping the board (message board and quest board) up and is really good at it. I don't see a problem keeping it that way and have someone else try to do Front Desk as a different charter.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">What about @Freedom? StarTree is basically doing @Freedom's charter.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Maybe StarTree should be the Mayor!</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree doesn't want to be the major! StarTree wants to be free!</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Maybe we should emphasize the difference between Place Level, and the Top Contributor. If we keep @Freedom's charter unique, then it means that StarTree had been leveling up Freedom Plaza. James, the Mayor, can still be the Mayor in the RP story, but the leaderboard should show StarTree next to @Freedom because she is the Top Contributor.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">There is no rule that a charter needs to be unique. Two charters can be the same. The score should go to the person in charge of the one that is contributing. I don't want a charter to exist by itself. I want each charter to embody what its writer aspires to do. If you make a charter, it should be something you care about and would take charge working on it. It should have that personal connection.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then what was it about "a charter is not yours, it belongs to the 
  <msg spk="LRRH">That is if you go AFK on a charter that other people in the guild need. For example, if you make a charter saying that you want to be the one designing our characters, and ask people to send request to you, then you go AFK, the requests are going to at your place. But the requests and the workspace do not belong to you. The rest of the guild may go to your place and help out finishing them. You don't have an exclusive right to the orders. Anyone is allowed to help. Then, say the rest of the guild kept doing that for a few weeks and got it running really well, and then you return from your absence, you don't have a right to kick out the rest of the guild and take the place for your own. The place is never "yours" to beging with. It belongs to the guild because it is a chartered place.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I want to say I understand half of it, but I think it is more like one-third.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Sasha is disappointed that Red didn't say the magic word for her to use ARP. Explanations like this are important perspectives and should be written as part of the guild rule.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I'm not good at speaking in rules! When I say something is a rule, people misinterpret it and do weird things! So just let me ramble!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think Red is saying a charter exists for a person to declare how they want to help others. Once declared, everyone else is free to join and get credits for helping regardless whether they do it under the organization of the person who first wrote the charter. A charter exists to inspire, not to control. <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa><mbrec>Evelyn is now recognized as Cleric.</mbrec></msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think I understand what Evelyn said.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH"><mbmerit>Red gives Evelyn Merit.</mbmerit>So, as I was saying, since it is clear that StarTree is good at, and is passionate maintaining our board, by that I mean this dashboard, I think it would make most sense if you craft Charter 18 according to what she does. You don't need to intentionally set new goals or cover task no one is doing for the guild. You may just focus on what you already do. We get problems when people try to declare more than what they are passionate about.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Then the score of @Freedom is wrong. When I go to the board I consider myself going to StarTree's, not James's. James's usefullness is less than monthly.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I agree. No offense to James. For those who might read this later, the current Place Level EXP of Freedom Plaza is 15. It is at the top of the leaderboard. We are saying that it shouldn't be there because it is taking credits for what was done by StarTree.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree did the scoring!</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">You did it wrong then. But according to Red's intention, we can't write a charter for you. You have to write your own.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Can StarTree have no charter like Vivi's? StarTree wants to be free!</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">This discussion is going too long. How about we sleep over it and resume later?</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <msg spk="James">It seems that my Charter had caused some trouble. I have updated it to <a class="">Version 3</a> and deducted some points from my Place EXP. Everyone is doing great. Let's keep up the good work! <mbkudo>Mikela receives Kudos from James for creating Mikela Jump.</mbkudo><mbmerit>James is awarded Merits by LRRH.</mbmerit></msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">@Board now has a <a class="">Charter</a> and leads the Place EXP leaderboard as Level 4!</msg>

  <div class=""><b><b>POLL:</b></b> There is a backlog from Cardinal Quest field notes that should be scored but StarTree doesn't now how to score them!
  </div><hr class="">
  <div id="P202201132100-Inner">
  <msg spk="Tanya">If someone is present or checked in, they should get 1 EXP on the guild log column.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">I think that is already done minus errors. What about the other credits? In the field log there are stars. Are people supposed to get a point per star?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I envision that the document map will be used as a score board. When something is done, you put your name there then Google Sheets may just count your names. On the same cell, there would also be a status flag, and Google Sheet can read that to format the cell color.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Show me how it is done so I can tell if the scoring is wrong.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's score today. Blackchecked in. Then later Casey joined. So they should appear on our daily row. ‚úÖ Then as you go down, you see Casey got a Star mark for searching for courtyard leyline. So you would put [Casey] under the Part column on the row Courtyard leyline. In this case, she hasn't finished, so you could jus leave the cell white.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">According to James, white should mean a situation where no one has any info. Yellow is for a situation where someone could work on.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then let's put an @ for yellow. # for brown, and $ if it is done (Green).</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Can a name appear more than once in a cell?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">No. Tasks that are difficult would have multiple columns. Next, Casey mapped out what we need for the Reservoir. So that is $ [Casey]. Next, Casey determined that there is no need for a scroll there. So it would be .[Casey]. Next, Casey tried to look for the Rosetta Crystal, so @[Casey] there. So based on the log alone, Casey scored 4 EXP today. She was scoring more points if we dig deeper and count the descriptions in our Master Map. But we can do that when we do the Master Map scoring.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">The counter is now online!</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">StarTree, you don't need to go through our field logs and do the scoring for us. I think the deal is whoever wants EXP need to log their score by themselves. If there is a problem or dispute on who did what, they we can go to the log to verify. You don't need to go through the log and check that each star is counted. It would be tedious and inefficient because you would end up asking us which column you should put someone's name. The person who did the quest should know that and enter it by themselves. If they don't know it they shouldn't be getting an EXP.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree is not needed!</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">StarTree, could you help us on something else? It is about the side journal. Let's talk at Court Arsenal.</msg>

      ‚≠ê This charter maintains its commitment to provide a publicly viewable discussion and information hub for peacemakers to discuss, plan and to bond with each other, although those functions are met by StarTree @Board and Cardinal @Cardinal. To continually support their contributions, this charter will focus on backing up their contents, and adding/linking contents from older versions of the forum to make it convenience to see the whole story that was scattered in different media.

  <div class=""><b><b>POLL:</b></b> The effort on quest and the credits seem disproportional. Getting EXP from the actual cardinal quest is WAY harder than doing normal guild quest. Can we fix that?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div id="P202201202100-Inner">
  <msg spk="Tanya">We are limited by simplicity. For a single task that is long, we are rewarding maximum to those who do enough, then let others continue, instead of those who try to do the whole thing by themselves.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But maxing out after 1 EXP per task is too soon. Five or so should be more appropriate. And I think that the accounting shouldn't be driving the behavior. If people want to help, then let them help all they want and reward them accordingly. The accounting needs to be upgraded to reward people who are helping.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">@Ivy, could you upgrade the accounting? I don't want people to start making rows in Guild Log just to track the additional EXP they should get. I want the Cardinal Quest Map to handle the field scores alone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">The scoring map is now upgrade to count the number of times a name appears even if it is in the same cell. I also added some columns to help audit for errors, and added 4 points for Ledia on her cell today. Now we can see that Zoey is leading the scoreboard with 21 points, followed by Ledia and Evelyn with 8 points each.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Thank you, Ivy. Eight points for today sounds about right. @Zoey, how did you get so many points? <mbkudo>Ledia gives Ivy Kudos.</mbkudo></msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I was there almost every day.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I've just added more auditing statics. I think Zoey got 15 points or more on the same day. She got them from mapping and sending out orders.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So it wasn't just because she was there everyday. There are some tasks that are easier to get EXP.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">When you are there everyday, you would be right there when you the opportunity to get easy EXP comes. It balances out. You got 8 points in one day, I have 21 points total. I am sure I was there more than 3 days. So on average you are getting more points than I did per day. If you keep at that pace you will catch up in no time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That is encouraging.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">I am going to add a new leaderboard for Cardinal Quest alone! First with Fort Arsenal scores, Deer Crossing will be added back later when we get to it! @James, please don't freak out!</msg>
  <msg spk="James">THE GAME IS ON!</msg>

  <div class=""><b>How</b> do people feel about the game we had on Sunday? What do you want to add most to our game? Or what does our game need the most?
  </div><hr class="">
  <msg spk="Zoey">Can we just keep playing first? I am dying to shoot something down with my bow XD</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think the format of the game is fun, but not as satisfying because we aren't earning real EXP unlike the actual Cardinal Quest. I don't want to get EXP from Cardinal Quest, then use that EXP to play a different game. I think we were doing okay translating our field notes into a story, but it would help if we know what we will be dealing with ahead of time.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Ledia, that is what I am going for. I am not trying to just play random games. @Tanya, what will be tomorrow's Cardinal Quest?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Tomorrow we will try to deal with the spawn point at the Geyser. The overall drill will be similar: Zoey will lead us to the spawn area according to the reports, we will try to clear the area and wait for them to respawn to know the exact spawn point, then we will seal it while fighting adds.</hide>
  <button class="". What kind of monster will we be fighting?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> We only have rough descriptions. I believe it is a highly armored monster that can shoot water jets. But we are doing the scouting on the same day, so we don't know it right now.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> We will be fighting a 
  <button class="". I was hoping that we would get ahead on Sunday.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I like how in our Cardinal Quest we don't have to worry about dying. If we all get KO'ed we can just continue the next day. But I think our field notes was a little strange. It is not in chronological order, so I can't see a story from it, and my memory is not very good. üòÖ</hide>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I noticed that too.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I was trying to make it easier keep score. The problem we had earlier, was that if we just mark when someone scores a point in the timeline, the person keeping score would need to read the whole thing to know where to put that point on the scoring map. So we started keeping a separate section to track scores, ordered by location. Then we didn't bother also keeping the chronology, and just mark on the field scoring map directly.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b>  @Ivy, any thoughts?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> It sounds like you want to sort the same data sometimes by time and sometimes by location. Then your field log should probably be a spreadsheet and not a text file.</hide>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If try to do that on a table, wouldn't we need to enter the time and the location everytime? That would be tedious.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> You could use a macro then bind it to a shortcut key.</hide>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. I'll try it.</msg>

      <br>The police posted a sign "Beware of Pickpockets". And the pickpockets saw that when people see the sign, they reach for and check their wallets. Then the pickpockets know where their wallets are!

    <div class=""><b>A</b> security gate scans an ID on a vehicle before letting it in. If the ID is not recognized, the scanner will send a short pulse and the gate will not open. If the ID is recognized, the scanner will send a long pulse that is three times as long as the short one, and the gate will open. What is the simplest cheat to get the gate open with an unrecognized ID?</div>

      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Black:</b> I don't know if this helps, but if the scanner is electronic, its pulses are usually generated based on the resonance frequency of a quartz crystal. Depending on how the crystal is cut, the crystal frequency could change outside its intended operation range.

<div class=""><b>For</b> more than a decade, Microsoft had gamified their search engine. You earn points when you search with Bing, and you could trade those points for gift cards. Is this Arcacian?
</div><hr class="">
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> It would make certain assumptions about statistics invalid, but overall it is Arcacian because arguably when people use a search engine, it helps others who are using it, and no one is forced to participate.
<msg spk="Evelyn">I like how you could choose to donate the points. Should we start using Bing?</msg>
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Do we get guild credits for using Bing?
<msg spk="LRRH">I don't know what it is. Could someone explain it?</msg>
<msg spk="Zoey">It is just a reward program that you could earn points toward getting a gift card for using Bing.</msg>
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> How does that help people? I don't understand.
<msg spk="Zoey">According to <button class="">this</button> it helps prevent Google from dominating the search engine market.</msg>
<msg spk="LRRH">Hmm... I would say no, because if you use Bing, you are already getting Bing reward, so the guild doesn't need to give you a reward even if using Bing helps people.</msg>
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I meant if we get Bing rewards for the Guild.
<div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> <ht>In that case that would just be the same as donating to the Guild. Donors should get a reward.
<msg spk="LRRH">We have never tied guide credits to a monetary value. I feel that if we tie it to a monetary value, then there will be a lot more bureaucracy and book keeping, because people will start treating the guild like a bank or a place of guaranteed employment because we don't turn down people trying to do a guild quest.</msg>
<msg spk="Ledia">I am not asking the guild to let people cash out their credits. But if people donate money to the guild they should get credits.</msg>
<div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I don't have an objection if there is no cashing out guild credits. How many credits should a donor get?
<msg spk="Ledia">That's an interesting question. How about 1 credit per dollar?</msg>
<msg spk="LRRH">Hmm... but what do we do if the value of a dollar changes?</msg>
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Should we use a meal as a reference? If someone feeds the guild one simple meal, then it is worth 1 credit. Suppose the market price of a simple meal is $5, then the current conversion is 1 credit for every $5.
<msg spk="Ledia">That seems too low...</msg>
<div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>LRRH:</b> I don't want to give Guild points for people simply browsing the internet or playing trivia. I would rather people just do the guild quests. And <hl>we don't really need monetary donations</hl> so I would shelf that topic until it becomes more relevant.
<hr class="">
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> In summary, Bing reward is an Arcacian mechanism but it doesn't have enough peacemaking quality for our guild to award credits. Thank you for the comments.

  <b>Cardinal:</b> Zoey, Evelyn, in this game you were a kid. You only have 1 hit point.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Understood.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Yes.</msg><br>
  <b>Cardinal:</b> Does the hunting party have a leader? What is the plan or formation going to the woods?<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I'm the party leader.
  <msg spk="Ledia">The plan is StarTree will lead the way because, according to Ivy, the Snake bit her every day.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">The others who can intercept or stun will follow StarTree nearby to stun the Snake when it appears. All others follow further back, and encircle the snake once the fight starts.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Tanya had already seen the Snake's attack pattern. An AE attack will happen in round 2 and 4, dealing 2 and 4 damages. If you will get KO at the start of round 2, close in after it does the AE and get out of range at the end of round 3.</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">Gotta dance!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">For those who can fly, decide for yourself whether you can safely fly in heavy rain.</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Natalie:</b> Do we see lightning and thunder at the moment? I can normally sense how bad the weather.
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Does it cost you anything to do so?</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">It doesn't. It is kind of part of my intuition.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Can you change the weather?</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">Sometimes...? Changing the weather is easier with wind magic. I can make a cloud rain, but once it rained it is gone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Natalie, roll once please.</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">Do we get our own die? There are 10 dice and one is blue.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">That's up to you and your party. We have many more dice.</msg>

      Do we have a guild policy on getting toys?
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Red:</b> It has to be cute.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> What about 
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Red:</b> It is cute except the crossbones.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> We have lots of LEGOs already. I thought we were trying to get rid of them.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Red:</b> But pirates is kind of Casey's theme.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> To be precise, it is treasure hunting.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> The problem with LEGOs is that once you get one, you would want to get more. Then you will need a place to put them since you won't be taking apart what you built.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> I can make space for it.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> I oppose because it has nothing to do with the guild's goal. You are free to play and display it in your place.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> What if I build Magic Bakery? Then it will promote the guild by drawing LEGO fans attention.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Red:</b> I'm leaning for it because it is cute.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> Do you mean you will get the pirate set and build a bakery from it? Or are you talking about a separate project to build a LEGO Magic Bakery in addition to displaying a pirate ship?</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Zoey:</b> What if that ship is the Albatross?</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> The Albatross doesn't look like a pirate ship at all. It is not even the same color. The Albatross was white...</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Zoey:</b> Couldn't we just make it different this time around? We can make it whatever we want.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Red:</b> I am still leaning toward a yes. Especially when they would build Magic Bakery. I want to see that.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> I don't see why we can't just build it together.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Red:</b> I am ready to approve that as a guild activity.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> Couldn't you just have 3B draw it? Then we don't need a physical model.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> If you do that I can't really participate. Besides, 3B hasn't drawn anything for months.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> If you build a LEGO Magic Bakery set, then she really won't be drawing anything.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> Why not? If anything it should make it easier to draw having a model to look at.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> By then you would just take photographs, and the guild website will look like a LEGO fan site.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> If we take photos, we could just keep them in its own thread. I am not controlling what is shown in the calendar.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> Does this mean... each of us will have a LEGO person?</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> It won't look exactly like you.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> I'm curious... üò≥</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Red:</b> This is Ivy as a Minifig.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> CUTE!! It looks like you!</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> I didn't ask for it. But more importantly, it can't depict each of us. So I am against using LEGO as our art medium. </hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> What about these other LEGO people? Are they... someone?</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Red:</b> They were in another story and are townsfolks at Freedom Plaza. In fact 3B drew at least three of them.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> I wish that they would join our story.</hide>

  <div class="">
  <div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> @Casey, draw for fishing result please. You have a fishing rod, so you may draw two balls from the bag.<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Do we get to use Advantages?<br>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes, but each time you use it you need a different reason.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Hmm... I will just draw first and see.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> (Ball x2)=1,1.</hide>
  <msg spk="Casey">I use an advantage that I am patient.</msg>

  <msg spk="Casey">This is way harder than it looks...</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>V:</b> May I also fish at the same time?
  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes, and everyone else who plan to fish.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Sasha, we fish together.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Let's see how lucky we are.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> (Ball x1)=2.</hide>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I use my Lucky trait.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> (Ball x1)=1.</hide>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I guess 2 is not too bad.</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> We should try to get a 3, within reason.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> (Ball x1)=1.</hide>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I use Insight for Casey.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Oh, thanks.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> (Ball x2)=3,1.</hide>
  <msg spk="Casey">Hey, it is working!</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Do you want bait?
  <msg spk="Casey">Yes!</msg><br>
  <b>Casey:</b> Can I use Bait and Insight at the same time and draw 3 balls to keep two?<br>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I like that idea. And if the GM allows it, we should stack it even more so we draw all balls and choose two.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Then I stack my patience and good at swimming.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The fishing rod already lets you draw two balls. So with a stack of 4 advantages, you would be able to draw all balls. @GM?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Who is the GM?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">I assume it is Sasha since this is not combat.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I am okay with it because this feels more cooperative and less tedious. But, @Cardinal, could you GM the rest of the game? I am a player. It feels weird to be GM'ing at the same time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">If you want me to GM, I will add details to the rule.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's fine.</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> With a stack of five advantages (including the fishing rod), roll 6 dice. As long as not all of them fail, you succeed and get 5 fish. Otherwise it is an epic failure.
  <msg spk="Cardinal">An epic failure would prevent you from fishing again today.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Hold on. @Tanya, is this a good deal or not? If I do nothing, I get 4 fish. If I gamble, I either get 5 fish or none for today.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If you gamble, your chance of getting no fish is only 1 in 64, that is about 1.5%.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">That's not exactly what I'm asking. Your answer would be the same even if I didn't already have 4 fishes. But the more fish I have, the more risky the deal is. What is that risk?</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> That's cost-benefit analysis.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> (Ball x1) = 3.</hide>
  <msg spk="Casey">Holy moly</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I need to go back to the lab. You kids can figure it out.</msg><br>
  <mbspell>Ivy gets 3 fish.</mbspell>
  <mbrec>Ivy is now recognized to be Lucky Rank A.</mbrec>
  <div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I see.<br>
  <b>Sasha:</b> The cost of gambling is 4 fish because that is what you are betting. The benefit is...98.5% to get 5 fish, which is 4.9. So you should still do it.<br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> Hold on. I think we should see V's result first, then start with the lowest risk gamble.<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>V:</b> I fish.<br>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>V:</b> (Ball x1) = 1.</hide><br>
  <b>Cardinal:</b> By the way, I am allowing a free attempt without advantages just because it could save time. If the opportunity is unique I will tell you beforehand that you have only one chance and need to stack your advantages if you decide to do so. So Casey, Sasha/Tanya, and V, each of you have one chance to stack advantages and try again if you choose to do so.<br>
  <b>V:</b> Instead of "fishing", may I just use Ice Carousel and get 3 fish?
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Yes.</msg>
  <mbspell>V gets 3 fish with Ice Carousel.</mbspell>
  <div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> With this there is no reason to take more risk. We should now have 17 water and 17 food to leave. If the wood gathering team would return with 17 rafts.
  <msg spk="Sasha">What if they don't?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then we leave Natalie, Red, and V behind. Red makes coffee brownies again and feed the group of three for the day and give each two actions. Natalie and V get their usual resources then all go finish their own rafts. There is no risk.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I still want to see stacked advantages at least once before we leave. Now I have 2 fish. With a stack of 5 advantages, 98% to get 3. I get 2.94 at the cost of 2. It is a better deal than 4.9 at cost of 4.</msg><br>
  <msg spk="Tanya">@Cardinal, I want to be recognized for the skill Foresee. It allows me to preview the result of a die roll.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But that takes the fun out of me.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We are in the same fishing team. You and me.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Well, then let's split up. You foresee your fishing and I just roll.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">You can't stop me from using foreseeing on your roll.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I don't mind if you foresee my result. Just let me roll and you may look at it before I look at it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">...</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">@Cardinal, since we rolled a 2, each of us have 1 fish. I want to bet my fish and roll again.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Your gain will be tiny. If you get a 3 ball that counts at 1.5.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I just want to roll more dice!</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I help you with insight. And I use Foresee on your roll.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I give you bait.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I give you fishing guidance.</msg>
  <msg spk="V">I'll help you freeze it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Plus my luck that is a stack of 5. @Cardinal, how do you want to do this?</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> First, Tanya rolls 3 dice for skill check.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> (D20x3)={5,18,16}</hide><br>
  <mbrec>Tanya is recognized to have the skill Foresee Rank B.</mbrec>
  <b>Cardinal:</b> Then Sasha rolls 6 dice for Tanya to see.
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's just creepy since I have already decided to roll.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> (D20x6)={7,7,2,1,1,1}</hide>
  <b>Casey:</b> HOLY MOLY! Sasha NEEDS stronger Lucky!<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Well. from your reaction it can only mean one thing. If Tanya tells me not to go forward I would listen.<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> You should just keep what you have.<br>
  <b>Sasha:</b> Well. I am not a stubborn person. I got to roll and it was fun. I listen to Tanya and keep my fish. Let me see what I rolled.<br>
  <msg spk="Sasha">It could be worse...</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Still, that's six tails in a row! and three 1's from D20! You were going to drown or something.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">@Tanya, what did you see?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't want to imagine bad things happening to my friends.</msg>
  <mbkudo><b>Cardinal gives Tanya Kudos.</b></mbkudo>
  <b>Sasha:</b> Although I wouldn't mind if you do.<br>
  <b>Casey:</b> Now that we have foresee, can I see if I can get 5 fish?
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't have enough mana for that. V is level 11. Foresee costs me 1 mana per dice. I already used 7 mana. If I use insight on you, I can only see three of your dice.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I only need 1 die to succeed though.</msg>
  <b>Tanya:</b> @Cardinal, Helen is only level 7. If we need to use abilities tonight, do we max out at 7 mana?<br>
  <b>Cardinal:</b> There is no rule on limiting mana now or tonight. You have 19 mana remaining.<br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> I see. Casey, do you want me to read your fortune?<br>
  <msg spk="Casey">I don't want to waste your mana. Could you read it one by one. I only need 1 to succeed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Tanya, your current Foresee is rank B. You have 50% chance of spending 1 mana without getting a reading.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That'll be too tedious.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">When you decide to use Foresee, roll one die, that costs 1 mana. If it is low, Then the divination fails and you can't use foresee for the same person that day. If it is high, then you can see up to six dice for that person. Total mana cost is 6 at the maximum.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. Then I'll see if I can tell Casey's fortune.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> (D20)=18. I will keep rolling.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> (D20...) = 3, 12.</hide><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Casey, if we give you advantage, you will succeed.
  <msg spk="Casey">Then I do it.</msg><br>
  <mbspell>Casey gets 5 fish.</mbspell>
  <b>Casey:</b> I still want to see the rest of my four dice...
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> (D20 x6)={3,12,12,2,6,5}</hide>

  <div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class="">
  <div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Food 18, water 21, rafts 14.3.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Details: StarTree 8 wood with axe and bonus during combat; Ledia 6 wood after drinking coffee. James and Kisaragi 14 wood each with coffee brownies and 2 person saw. Patricia and Black 6 wood each.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Details: Natalie 10 water with flask. Helen and Arcacia 3 water each.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Details: Ivy 3 fish; V 3 fish, Casey 5 fish, Sasha and Tanya 1 fish each.</msg><br>
  <b>Sasha:</b> We could almost all leave tonight.<br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> If we really want to, StarTree could just make 3 rafts right now since we could use as much mana as our level.<br>
  <b>Sasha:</b> But there is no challenge and no drama. We could have just left on Day 1.<br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> Evelyn, do you still prefer we all leave tonight, or is it okay to leave some behind to leave tomorrow? I have a plan for that.<br>
  <b>Evelyn:</b> I still prefer us leaving together, although I don't want to make it stressful for anyone. üòñ<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Let's talk while we eat.<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Helen:</b> I bring out the fruit basket.<br>
  <b>Casey:</b> Thematically, do we really want to leave during heavy rain? It seems unsafe.<br>
  <b>Evelyn:</b> Wouldn't it be good if it stops raining when we leave?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Cardinal:</b> (D20)=13.</hide><br>
  <b>Cardinal:</b> As Evelyn wondered when the rain would stop, the rain seemed to be getting softer.<br>
  <b>Black:</b> We are banking on heavy rain so the "flies" don't come out.<br>
  <b>Evelyn:</b> I wish that the flies do not come regardless. üòñ
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Evelyn, roll with advantage please.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> (D20+) = {7,18}</hide><br>
  <b>Cardinal:</b> Soon after the castaway started eating, the rain subsided. The air was fresh, the sky was beautiful, and there was no sign that any insect was going to come. It seems completely safe if they want to leave tonight.<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Mikela:</b> But I don't want to just leave with rafts that StarTree summons from nowhere. That is just anti-climatic. How about we have a contest for the best idea to leave together tonight?<br>
  <b>3B:</b> Could we repair the boat?
  <msg spk="Ivy">We don't have a relevant skill to repair fiberglass hull. If we tie rafts to it, it willl just drag the rafts down with it.</msg><br>
  <b>Zoey:</b> I know it won't work but I can summon a giant toad. They can't swim in saltwater.<br>
  <b>Black:</b> If your ability is back, you could just teleport us back.<br>
  <b>Mikela:</b> Actually I would prefer that than to be on a raft for another day.<br>
  <b>Sasha:</b> Is that it? Are we sick of this game setting and ready to move on to another one?<br>
  <b>Evelyn:</b> I prefer games that we don't have to think about leaving someone behind... üòÖ<br>
  <b>Sasha:</b> In terms of game mechanics, do you feel that there is anything we can learn from this game?<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I do like how the constraints force us to make plans. If we had just more people from food or water gathering on wood gathering today, We would have enough rafts to leave, since we could argue that Red and Natalie could gather food and water even on their rafts, we really only need 15 water and 15 food at the time we leave. Helen, Arcacia, and I could have went to gather wood. Then we would have enough to leave together.
  <msg spk="Ledia">We were adding too many rules to update the plan.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">But we knew Natalie and Red's abilities since Day 1. I am not forgiving myself for such blantant 
  <div class=""></div><b>James:</b> Feeling that he hasn't been getting any attention as he deserves, James said, we have 14 out of 17 rafts. If I could drift on anyone of them, there is no way they can't carry us all if we just join some of them.
  <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Tanya:</b> That depends on how StarTree had been building them.</hide>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree copied what James did on the 
  <div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> This could work if on average everyone else weigh less than 80% of James' weight. From the look of it... This could be true...<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Helen:</b> Then when we join two rafts together, it could carry two adults and one kid.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">CUTE!!!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">If adults other than James takes 0.8 and kids take only 0.4 then we only need 13.8 rafts.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">7 rafts for 21 people. It is perfect.</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Mikela:</b> It looks like we have a WINNER!<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>James:</b> If you let James play, James will always save the day. We drift free tonight!<br>
  <mbrec>James is recognized as Rank S Free'ku Master.</mbrec>
  <b>Mikela:</b> And so the castaway formed three-people rafts and drift to safety! The End!<br>
  <hr class="">
  <div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Are we not actually picking who to drift with?
  <msg spk="LRRH">Who do you want to drift with, Tanya?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Arcacia.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">And?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Patricia.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Raft #1 is ready!</msg>

      My goal for Treasure this month is to tidy the showcase area.
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> To do so, I'm going to removing everything and start over. Things that don't fit will be kept in boxes or be donated.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> Are we talking about just the showcases? Or everywhere...?</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> I was planning to tidy just the showcases. Why?</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> 
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> I think we are in Rule 3: Finish Discarding First. I'm going to put everything in the showcases in boxes. Then we sort out what we want to keep and return to the showcase.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> When the showcases are empty, we might also decide a new place for them.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> Okay.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Sasha:</b> I think we should move the showcases because they aren't getting proper lighting. You can't really see what they have when you pass by them.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Tanya:</b> I like the way it is, out of sight and unnoticeable. It is too colorful and distracting otherwise.</hide>
      <div class="">‚≠ê</div>
      <b>Sasha:</b> I want to see them when we play games. <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Sasha:</b> If Tanya doesn't want to see them, she can sit with her back to them. </hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Tanya:</b> I'm fine with that.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> It seems we will make many changes. Perhaps more than we can handle...? üòÖ</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Casey:</b> Putting things in boxes and putting away those we don't need is my goal. We can decide the rearrangement when things become easy to move.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Tanya:</b> I suggest first putting everything on the table in boxes. I think we need to move the table.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Evelyn:</b> There are so many cute things on the table... üòÖ</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Tanya:</b> They will come back. But perhaps not on the table.</hide>

  <msg spk="Casey">Are we playing as ourselves or as the DC characters?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's up to you. The point of the game is to have fun and see what we can use in our game. But I heard this game is a strategy game. We might have abilities that would break the game. If you want to play yourself, please start with abilities in the game.</msg>

  <div class="">
  <div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>So.</b> How do we <i>do</i> Cardinal Quest nowadays? 
  <msg spk="Sasha">We are obviously doing Cardinal Quest almost every day, but there is no story and the day counter for Cardinal Quest doesn't reset.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">@StarTree, what is going on?</msg></div>
  <hr class="">
  <b>StarTree:</b> The typos you fixed for previous story will count as an update!
  <msg spk="StarTree">You should see the tracker reset tomorrow!</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That feels like a cheap shot though.</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> We are at Wisp Circle.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Who wants to help upgrade the leyline? It is only barely holding together.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I would help but I don't know how. üòñ</msg><br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> The leyline node at Wisp Circle is that it needs to switch depending mana type. Right now, we need the wisps that enter to cast a spell to do the switching before they can cast a spell in their language. What we really want is for the crystal aura to automatically decipher the language as they cast the spell.<br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> Previously, we have already decided 9 intonations the aura would check to tell what leyline to open. These 9 intonations together will control five mana gates. Let's start with the two easiest two intonations that controls the Arcacian gate.<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Okay. So the 7th intonation would start the Arcacian aura, and the 8th intonation will stop it. But how do we make the crystal do it?
  <msg spk="Ledia">By the way, I'm here. This seems like an interesting topic.</msg><br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> Let's find an example where the Crystal does something similar.<br>
  <b>Zoey:</b> I'll check to see if the Arcacian gate already checks for intonation.<br>
  <b>Zoey:</b> I found something...
  <msg spk="Zoey">I found a map of other intonations being used by the crystal, but not the ones we want.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That's expected because... that's why we need to add them.</msg><br>
  <b>Zoey:</b> @GM, do I get recognized for something? I think I found a clue.
  <msg spk="Sasha">I think you would already have high tracking skills. What do you want to be recognized for?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">How about "intuition" as applied to tracking? If there is no clue, I would tend to pick the right path where I would find the next clue.</msg><br>
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <mbrec>Zoey is recognized to have Intuition Rank A.</mbrec>
  <div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I also want to get some skills, but... I'm not really following what I need to do.<br>
  <b>Zoey:</b> Let's make a step by step guide on how we do this. Where should we put that guide?<br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> Let's add it to the biggest field book. Then we don't need to know which book to check. Since there is only one book.<br>
  <b>Evelyn:</b> I like that idea üòÉ<br>
  <mbspell>Zoey has left bread crumbs.</mbspell>
  <b>Zoey:</b> May I be recognized for another skill Bread Crumb? This allows others to follow my trail as I pursue things.<br>
  <mbrec>Zoey is recognized to have Bread Crumb Rank S.</mbrec>
  <b>Zoey:</b> Sweet.<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> It looks like someone gets it!<br>
  <mbkudo><b>Little Red Riding Hood gives Kudos to Zoey for having bakery-themed skill!</b></mbkudo>
  <b>Zoey:</b> XD ü§£<br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Thanks to Zoey's bread crumbs, I found something I can do. But it is late. Could we continue tomorrow?<br>
  <b>Tanya:</b> Yes, let's do that. This is not entirely urgent. We could even do it in the weekend.<br>
  <b>Evelyn:</b> I like this pace üòÉ.<br>
  <b>Sasha:</b> Just for my understanding. If you get to choose, would you rather play Adventure Begin, Wonder Woman, or Cardinal Quest this coming weekend?
  <msg spk="Ledia">Cardinal Quest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Cardinal Quest üòÉ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Cardinal Quest üòÜ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Care to tell why?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Cardinal Quest gives way more EXP. That is, if you leave me enough bread crumbs so I could get to where I could do something.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">We are actually helping the Wisps and that is important to me. We are helping people and having fun at the same time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">We played Adventure Begin already, and I'm not interested in a "strategy game" as you said for Wonder Woman. ü§£</msg><br>
  <div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Let's do Cardinal Quest this weekend first. @StarTree, could you set the schedule?<br>
  <b>StarTree:</b> It's done!<br>

  <div class=""><b>I</b> am marking March 9th as the date to be the start of our intermittent fasting trial.</div>
  <msg spk="Mikela">Really? It took you two weeks to start after watching the video?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Frankly I don't remember when we started. That was the day Red decided I could get Guild Credit for tracking it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I thought fasting is only for adults.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I didn't say I am doing it. It is just the day I start getting credits for tracking.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">For those who wants to join, I'll keep track of some health stats and investigate whether you are becoming more or less healthy.</msg>
  <br><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Do we also get credits for trying?
  <msg spk="Ivy">No.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Why not? We are helping you as guinea pigs.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">No you are not. I'm curious, but the data I get from you is not applicable to someone else. You are helping yourself, and I'm helping you figure out whether you are healthier.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But normally Paladins get credits for training and exercise.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">This is not a paladin program. I'm just offering a service. You are welcome to join for free. There is no pressure one way or another. You don't get points for joining and you don't get points deducted for not joining.</msg>
  <br><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> People don't normally get points for just staying healthy. 
  <msg spk="Tanya">You only get credits for bringing new healthy ideas or help other be healthy. If you join, even if you don't get credits for joining, you can get credits for sharing new ideas.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That is true. Although I don't want people to join hoping to find new ideas every day for credits... and, you don't need to join to get credits for new ideas.</msg>
  <br><div class=""? I don't think you described it.
  <br><b>Ivy:</b> I'm sorry. The program is you eat just once a day. 
  <button class="".</hide>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Eat for 1 hour and fast for 23 hours.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">And what is the purpose?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">The alleged benefit is that having a short eating time activates reparative pathways and your body will adapt to make itself stronger and healthier. Whereas if you just eat around the clock, the body won't have time to clean up and repair itself. The unrepaired damages manifest as aging.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Isn't sleeping supposed to be the time the body repairs itself?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">This program doesn't change your sleep pattern. But while you are awake, you are to eat just one meal. The question is whether this change in eating habit would improve health. If you want to try tweaking your sleep pattern and see if you are healthy with more or less sleep, you are welcome to try.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>I</b> think we can use JQuery to implement the Skill list, so that when you select a person, it will list all the skills for that person.</div>
  <msg spk="Ivy">This thread is for discussing how to do it and what it should show.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">The main concept is that there will be a hidden Blogger Page that lists the definitions of all Skills.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Each skill can be tagged by its associated Archetype, and a list of those who have that skill.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think we also need the Roster back.
  <msg spk="Ivy">The Roster can be another hidden page that lists all members.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I don't think what would be "Hidden". It would be a visible page. It should be displayed on the page bar.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I think you are right.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">At the Roster, you could have a button that lists all character that are recognized for different archetype or RPG class: Tank, DPS, Support, etc..</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like that idea. Let's start with the Profile/Roster first.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">This would mean moving the Profile section from Deer Crossing post to a page.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I was imagining a more elaborated character profile page, similar to what we had in Chapter 12.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">The levels at the Deer Crossing post are all old! I'm level 23 but it still says I'm level 17! XD ü§£</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">The content should be automatic or robo-made.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">For content that is robo-made and needs frequent update, it is easier if the whole content can be updated.</msg>
  <br><b>Ledia:</b> What is the first step?
  <msg spk="Ivy">Create a hidden character data page with names and level.</msg>
  <br><div class="">*something*</a>!
  <msg spk="Ivy">@StarTree, could you add Name and Level as attribute and value for each character?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">It's done!</msg>
  <br><b>Ivy:</b> Since data stored in div attributes are not displayed, next we need JS script to display them when the user clicks on a button.
  <msg spk="Ivy">Who wants to take charge of making the profile page? I have some other things to do.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I'd do that, with StarTree.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree is hired! Wee!~~</msg>
  <mbkudo><b>Ivy thanks Ledia and StarTree in advance.</b></mbkudo>
  <hr class="">
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> @StarTree, if I understand correctly, we need a JS function that composes the content for the given Div. Could you make that?
  <msg spk="StarTree">Does the function takes the character name as input, and display the content in the next div?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think we need a specified div name because the character names would be listed on a separate menu bar.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Understood!</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Could we get a personal section where we could just write whatever?
  <msg spk="Ledia">I mean a section that is not robo made.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">What do you want to call that section?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">"Custom profile"?</msg>
  <mbspell>There is now a custom profile section for Ledia!</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Awesome!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I don't feel like filling up my profile <i>again</i>...
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think you could get credit for importing anyone's profile from the old slides.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then someone else do it for me please.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> The roster needs URL enabled per member. But I can wait until there is actual content. Who is in charge of the Roster, so I could log the bug?
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think this falls under Makeover. Although I think StarTree will end out fixing it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> What can we do about Skill? I think Ivy is too busy to make updates. üòÖ
  <msg spk="Evelyn">What can we do to lower the lag counter for Chapter 20?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Most recently Ivy wanted to list signs of good health that one can check by themselves!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I like that idea! It will be useful. Where should we put it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it should be a page if it is a summary of everything on that topic.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I feel the pendulum is just swinging back and forth on whether the content should be in a page or in a post.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Our chapter posts should really be a page then? Since they are summaries.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We use posts because we were using Blogger Labels. Pages do not have labels.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">On the other hand, the advantage of pages is that they could be hidden from the user because there is no way to browse to a page without listing it on the page list.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then shouldn't the sign of health content be on a Blogger Post?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">The Page List right now only has content specific to the guild: The Calendar and the Roster. Everything else are in posts.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I don't think self-health check should be among the page list. Especially when we don't create its content.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then let's make a post. It is easy to change.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then you don't have a compelling reason to use a Page?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes I do. I think the URL of posts are ugly. But that is subjective. If we ever want to send someone else our list of healthy topics, I would prefer to send a link that is Page.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't foresee people would need to click on a label to navigate to related topics because we have collapsible Div. That whole Page could be its self-contained health check module.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I don't think people care about the URL. But it does look uglier now you mentioned it...</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">How do we browse to it if it is a page?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We could add a link to it at Adventurers' Hall or JQuery it from there.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I'm fine with it being a page.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Let's work on the content and help Ivy! üòä</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Could we call the page Pixie? Since the content will be similar to what Cardinal do for PHC-Player Health Check.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I'm for it! XD ü§£</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">It does sound more fun, and I think it ties better to the mission of the Adventurers' Hall.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Fun is good. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">As long as you don't fantasize the content. The content should not need further translation.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> How do we judge whether the YouTube content is legit?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">How about we add additional references as we learn more? I think as we collect more links, we can find better information and keep the better one.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> How should we mark which message to import?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Just write the message with no name at the credit column. Then we can easily filter out messages that are not status updates.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Roger!</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't think we need a filter for a credit-less row, since we have the at-sign to show just the todo list.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">There is that too.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">If we do that, doesn't it mean we don't need the Pipe at the credit column to mask rows without credit?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We can think about that later.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Or should we just write the entire non-status message in the credit row? It will get filtered also.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Is it really that bad if quest channel has its own row? üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">I moved the messages to its own row so we could try and see for today!</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The macro would break if you do that.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree can make another macro for just chatting!</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">The new macro is Ctrl+Shift+Q for messages! The original Ctrl+Shift+A is the same for rows with credits.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I like this.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">On my view I would filter out Quest chat message. Just so you know.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">We'll ping you if needed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">By the way, I vote for just going to the field earlier. Because the leyline is stronger there.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Could we get a more quest-like summary of what happened?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Basically, a new seaside settlement was planned without thorough survey and ingredients for its barrier were apparently lost in miscommunication.
  <msg spk="Tanya">So the settlers couldn't take care of the spawn points and called the Heroes for help.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Casey looked for alternative ingredients, while Zoey charted the spawn points and updated the maps.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">There were many confusions, and we decided that the original barrier planned for the settlement was too strong.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">With Casey's resourcefulness we got what we need to build a weaker but sufficient barrier.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">At this moment, everything seems good except we got banshee sailors getting through the barrier.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That was unexpected and even the original stronger barrier wasn't designed to block wraith-type monsters.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> So there is a ghost lurking in town.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Lurking is not the right word.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is pretty obvious, actually. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Apparently the design of the barrier drew them from their domain. If you try to cast summon-type spell, you would get the banshee along with what you summoned.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The banshee doesn't hurt anyone but its aura makes what you summoned invisible.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I hope that this is an easy fix. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">The sages already said they don't know why it happens yet, so the settlers would have to live with that for now. XD üòÜ</msg>

  <msg spk="Casey">Yes, of course.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What is the objective? Is there something specific we are looking for?</msg>

  Treasure Islands</small></center><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>On</b> this fine Sunday we go to Treasure Islands to look for exotic upgrades and treasures.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Have we decided whether to donate the old camera?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">We shouldn't take too much time deciding that, so I put it back to the shelves.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think we should explain to the reader that by Treasure Hunting we really mean thrift store shopping. And often times we also donate things. Sometimes we donate back the things we bought there... XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The old camera wasn't from a thrift store.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">You could just keep it if you want. It is not like we have to donate everything we don't use. I have lots of stuff I don't "need" and I'm keeping them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I know you can keep it, but what is the significance of this camera?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It was the camera Magic Bakery used to publish a photo book. I see it as a witness... or perhaps an author.</msg>
  <mbrec>Little Red Riding Hood now designates the camera as a Baker and Treasure of Magic Bakery.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="LRRH">It is part of Magic Bakery family and it shall be displayed along our book.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Thank you.</msg>
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <mbaa>LRRH receives</mbaa>
  <mbkudo><b>Tanya thanks Red for the decision. </b></mbkudo>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I like this ending. üòä</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> On the other hand I still think we have too many board games.
  <msg spk="Sasha">There is no 'We', those are mine. So mind your own business.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">They are yours, but they are also in the guild.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I'm trying to make games for us.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then why is this Zombie game here? It is cheesy and graphical.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I just thought we could use the board for our own game since the game looks SO BAD I am sure no one would be sad if we destroy it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">In case you don't know certain someone here is against breaking a game and taking just the components.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">If the game is complete and good, someone else could have enjoyed it. It is a waste to break it apart.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's why I got this.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">But it is... new. The components aren't even open.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That is evidence that NO ONE in their right mind would want to play it!</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">We don't know that. If you want it just for the game board, I would rather make you one than knowingly destroy a new game.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Bad games just sit on the shelves until the staff takes them off and put them in garbage! You are so afraid of destroying it but that will be its fate anyway! We are saving it!</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">
  <msg spk="Tanya">I have an idea. How about we don't get a game just for its components unless it is already on the shelves for more than 2 weeks. The price tags have dates we could check.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">How about we ask the staff how long they let a game sit on the shelves?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Evelyn:</b> It turns out that there is no rule and many of the price tags don't have a date. üòÖ
  <msg spk="Sasha">You're making too big of a deal out of it, since it must be really cheap when I got it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Hey, I found what we came for.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">We just got here. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">There are even different colors for us to choose. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I don't mean we have to leave. This is really common and I expected to be able to find some.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So now let's see if we can find something 'Rare'.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Do we get points for finding something?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">No, this is considered "entertainment" and you are not the entertainer.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What if I get it for the guild?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Not really. Normally I already got the point for suggesting that we need something. Then, when I get it, I simply complete that quest. But I already got the credit.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That doesn't sound quite right.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it is fine. If you discover something good you can still get credits.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What if there is wish list and I just run the errand to get them? Do I get points or not?</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">You get points for shopping for supplies.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I think for non-supply items, you don't get points for shopping because you could have just ordered them online.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But we don't just order them online if we know we could get them cheaper elsewhere. So I think shopping for those things should worth some guild credits.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think Ledia is onto something. The guild didn't recognize some tasks to be credit worthy when they should be.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">If the guild gives credits, should it be when someone searches for it or when someone buys it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think both.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">No credits for shopping, because people tend to shop and browse for too long.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">If your idea is good and you get credits. It doesn't matter whether you need to buy something or you could make it work with what you already have.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What if someone has many good ideas but don't make them happen? They already got the credits for suggesting it, they won't have the incentive to make it happen.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I'll do something if people abuses that trust. As Casey said, the assumption is that if you make a good suggestion in good faith, you intend to fulfill it if you can. If you can't do it alone, then you would have created a proper quest and those working on it would get credits. This is not really different from how StarTree gets credits for upgrading the board.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Once it is logged, someone else helping to fulfill it could get credits also.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So do I get credits in this case because we as a team came to get something, and we as a team got the thing we came to get?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">No I classify this as entertainment. I don't want to give a point for everyone who tags along in addition to the point you already get by participating in chat.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I still think there is something missing in the rules. I'll think about it.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, did Casey get a point for getting the leyline material?
  <msg spk="StarTree">Casey got a point in the generic "Shopping" category for today!</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I'm totally fine with that. I already have many points and I don't really use them anyway.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Casey has the third highest score in the guild!</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">And Casey has just got another point in the "Good Deed" category for helping another shopper!</msg>
  <mbaa>Casey receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="StarTree">That was another three points from Arcacia, in case it wasn't obvious!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I am okay with being seen as coming for entertainment. I'm not here "to get points".</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But points should be given when a person does something good or help other people.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">In our scoring there is no rule to deduct points when someone is being bad or inconveniencing other people. But I believe that if you get too few points, Arcacia would settle the difference.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then when Arcacia gave Casey points, it could be interpreted as she agreeing that Casey had been getting too few points.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I wouldn't draw that conclusion. Especially when you didn't get Arcacia Award for saying that.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Shopping in general takes too long. That's not the purpose of the guild. You are paying too much attention to it. You are not going to get dozens of points just by shopping for the whole day compared to what you would get from Cardinal Quest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We do get points shopping for Cardinal Quest. But I don't think there is a difference in principle. The only difference is that we got used to logging tasks during Cardinal Quest. Then, since Cardinal Quest log gave us a point, we got used to getting a point when it is convenient to log it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The difference in scoring between the two--Guild and Cardinal Quest--is not based on principles, but on the convenience of scoring.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">People aren't getting points unless the task is logged. In cases like this, we aren't logging, so we are losing all kinds of points.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">If you think you should get a point, then you should log it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But why would I log it if I know that the guild doesn't intend to give a point?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Even if you log zero point, you would still create a record of your effort. Then retrospectively if the rules are corrected you would get the points back.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But that's so... inconvenient.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Sasha:</b> There is no good game here today. I'm done looking.
  <msg spk="Zoey">What about this Monopoly-ish game? It has been here for a long time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But it is complete.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But our conclusion was if it had been here for a long time, its next destination would only be the dumpster.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That was my argument!</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then are you agreeing or not?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I am so confused!! @Tanya come make a reading!</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I'm right here...</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Tanya, will this game go to the dumpster if we don't get it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">@Cardinal.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Tanya doesn't have a skill that can predict the game would go.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Aren't you the Oracle?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Not in this sense. We can't easily tell the outcome unless we get the staff to tell us if someone buys it or if they discarded it. We can't even do a skill check on it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Can't you just pretend and roll the dice anyway?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">... If that's what you want.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Actually we could roll on whether the game will still be here the next time we return.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But that's assuming that we don't buy it right now. I don't see the purpose of this guess. It is just meaningless gambling.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">If you roll and it says it won't be here, wouldn't that mean someone bought it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">No it wouldn't. The staff could have just cleaned up and removed it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">About that... I think if we come often enough, we can tell the difference between an item is gone because it was sold or discarded. If the staff cleaned up, many things would be gone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">No you can't tell. You can't tell if a boardgame fan just happen to buy lots of them. Without asking someone who knows what happened to it, you can only tell if you happen to catch the moment when it is bought, or when staff puts it in the clean up cart.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think you are right.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then I ask a question. Why do you want to get it in the first place?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">To be honest I don't really want to get it except the tokens are cute, especially the bicycle one.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">For the reader, we are talking about 
  <msg spk="Tanya">The tokens are so small. And I don't foresee us making any game that wouldn't use tokens that are ourselves.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I didn't say I would use it for a game we make. I just said it is cute. By itself.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">There is no end if we try to get every cute thing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But it is small! It won't bother anyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But it is also useless and meaningless. It is not relevant to Magic Bakery.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If we have a bunch of different tokens, it would be interesting, although still irrelevant.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't think we should get board games just for its part thinking that they would be useful for making our own games without first knowing what game we would most likely make.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I did think about it. If we directly make an Arcacia Quest game, it would have a world map and the purpose of the game is to use your resources and opportunities to gain members and try to be the best country.
  <msg spk="Zoey">That was Chapter 23 Philosophy Arena. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">We haven't finished it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then components wise you only need a board, tokens to represent people, and some cards to represent you, your principles, and world events.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Component wise we have enough because we already have wooden tokens from Risk without the rest. If the game is good and you want people shaped tokens we could just get meeples by themselves without breaking a game.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it is better if we keep the game components simple and readily replaceable so that people could just print their own and play it with whatever tokens they want, and, since they can print it by themselves, they may scale it to the size they want or depending on the size of the tokens they use.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I like that idea. Maybe we should continue the Philosophy Arena game?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That game doesn't actually need a game board. It just needs tokens to represent followers of a philosophy. But I want to have a face for each philosophy, so I want to keep Fina, Natasha, and Alice.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Should we make LEGO people for them? Then we can just take pictures and post online.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I second that idea.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">What should we use as tokens for the followers? Other LEGO people?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">We do have a lot of LEGO people.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I guess we would just make the leader of each philosophy taller by having them stand on a stand.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So. The course of action: 1) Build Alice, Fina, and Natasha as LEGO people. 2) Restart the game by posting photos.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I wonder if that would be too offensive? üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Actually I would be surprised if we get any attention. We have a long way to go.</msg>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [6:29 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> And so we made LEGO Natasha (Red), Fina (Green), and Alice (Blue), and also Mikela as the host.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Mikela:</b> Hey Hey Hey! Welcome to Philosophy Arena Reboot! Here three philosophies will compete in their number of followers.
  <msg spk="Mikela">To participate, please endorse one of the philosophies. You may change your endorsement until the game ends, The winner is the philosophy with the most endorsements!</msg>

  <div class=""><b>About</b> Albatross, on Twitter I am discussing about the definition of Property, as in Private Properties versus Public Properties. Could we make a page about it so I could link to it?
  </div><hr class="">
  <msg spk="Casey">What is there to discuss? It seems pretty self-explanatory.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Someone said that "Private Property" is an oxymoron because all properties are private.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">That makes no sense.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I don't think we can debate about it unless we have a definition of what a property is.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Something that belongs to the public is public property, Something that does not belong to the public but belongs to specific people are private properties.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">What does belong imply?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">It means you can move it around or decide what to do about it. For example, if a house is my property, then I can decide what to with it by myself. If a house is public property, then the public decides what to do with it, no one may decide by themselves what to do with it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> In the context of describing decision rights, an object X is referred to as the Property of Y when Y has decision rights on X.
  <msg spk="Casey">That sounds like what I just said.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I was just translating your example into a definition. Red needs a definition.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think both are important. Example and definition. It this definition correct?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If by "correct" you mean whether it covers what people normally mean, then I believe so.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">And, this might not be what you need, but I want to draw a difference between "property" and "custody". In general, we say that X is in Y's custody when Y is does not have the rights to harm or destroy X. But we say that X is a property of Y when Y has the rights to do so.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">This might come in handy if we could get it on a page...</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">@Zoey, could you add it for us?</msg>

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>What</b> is our definition of Authoritarian?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ledia:</b> Authoritarian means people are commanded on what to do instead of choosing what to do. It is the opposite of being autonomous.
  <msg spk="Ledia">If a restaurant offers three choices of meals, but someone would punish you if you don't choose Meal A, then that someone is being authoritarian.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">If you are allowed to choose the meal you want and no one would punish you, then it is autonomous.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What about laws that disallow stealing? Is that authoritarian or autonomous?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What do you mean by "disallow". If the law simply states that "People who steals are allowed to be stolen from," then it is not authoritarian.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Treating people the way the treater others is not authoritarian. You don't need to make a law to tell people to retaliate. People would autonomously choose to retaliate if the law allows.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Does that make stealing legal or illegal?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">In terms of guild membership, that would be illegal. If you steal from inside or outside a guild, the guild will kick you out. If you steal from the outside, and the guild does not kick you out, the guild would become a target of retaliation.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">And a guild having its own membership rules is not authoritarian?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">It is not authoritarian when guild membership is a result of mutual agreement. Both sides need to agree. A person can't demand a guild to accept them, and a Guild can't just say something is their member without their consent.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think we are getting somewhere interesting...</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> What about a law that says people can't have more than one home? Is that authoritarian?
  <msg spk="Ledia">It depends on what the law actually says. If the law says, "Our system only registers one home per person. Unregistered homes are considered available for someone with no home to register as theirs." then it is not authoritarian.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">You mean... someone without a home can then just register that home and be a rightful owner?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Yes. By the way, I am not arguing whether such law is morally good or bad. I am strictly commenting on what makes a law authoritarian vs autonomous.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">For my understanding, what would make that law authoritarian?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">If the law says, "If you own more than one home we will put you in jail", then than would be authoritarian.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What if the law says, "If you own more than one home, then we consider you an object that can be stored in a storage room." ?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">It is authoritarian because the subject is no longer the home but the person.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What about, "If you claim to own more than one home, then we recognize that you are capable of splitting up into as many parts as the number of homes you own and simultaneously occupy them."</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That would be autonomous, but doing so does not give the law the right to separate the person into parts. The person would have to separate themselves to demonstrate legitimacy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Can we... not talking people separating into parts? üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But P4 can do that. In that law, would P4 be allowed to own four houses while others may only own one?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Her split is not permanent. So her legitimacy of owning four houses should also be temporary.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What about StarTree? StarTree can clone herself by budding.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">You don't need extraordinary examples, human can have kids... the kids can have their own home.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">The difference seem superficial. I don't think people would accept this difference.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">The difference is subtle in words, but not so in how the society is organize.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> An authoritarian society may ban or require carrying of personal protection weapons, where as a voluntarian society would let each individual decide by themselves.
  <msg spk="Ledia">In a voluntarian society, individual groups can still define their membership conduct.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What if a guild decides that it is legal for its members to bully others? Would gang violence be legal then?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">To that guild, yes, it would be considered legal. But so would be another guild that declares that it is legal for its members to protect people who are bullied, and such a guild may have a guild rule so that if you don't help the guild protect innocent people, you cannot be part of the guild. The members are allowed to leave the guild.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What if the guild has a law that it is legal to hunt down deserting members?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That type of law is authoritarian because when it denies members the right to leave.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But they might have signed a contract and agreed on being hunt down if they desert the guild.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">In voluntarism, such contracts are not enforceable. When someone tries to hunt you down for deserting, from Paladins perspective it is the same as they initiating an unprovoked attack on a free person. Unless the person being hunted voluntarily allows its former guild mates to hunt them down, then it would be considered a consensual interaction.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">How do you put that concisely? What doesn't voluntarism cover?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Voluntarism only covers the case when all parties maintain consent for the continuation of the interaction, with the concept of implied consent where a party is allowed to be treated the way they treat others.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So in the case of a member deserting a guild, the guild is only allowed to desert the member in return. It doesn't give the guild a right to hunt down the ex-member unless the ex-member is hunting down the guild.</msg>
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Zoey">May the guild hunt down an ex-member if they possess sensitive information that would threaten the personal safety of its members.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">No. Voluntarism only covers the case if the guild divulges personal information if the ex-member divulges theirs. If a guild starts hunting others, regardless whether they were ever a member, just because they have the ability to hurt them, then anyone may also hunt down that guild just for having the ability to hunt others. Paladin guilds don't hunt others just because others can hunt. Intention to initiate a hunt is also required to justify preemptive strike.</msg>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [11:18 AM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> How should I name the difference between these two: 1) An interaction happens due to mutual agreement, 2) An interaction happens due to a party acts on another without their consent, and the other retaliates under implied consent.?
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think (1) is mutualism, (2) is voluntarism. When you retaliate, you are still acting from your volition. Voluntarism includes situations where a person initiates a voluntary attack.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If voluntarism just means people act on their volition, then we need a word that means mutualism plus implied consent.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What about reciprocationism? It means treating other the way they treat others. It covers mutualism when people reach an agreement before acting.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Yes, I think we need that word.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> We are in a hurry.
  <msg spk="Casey">We haven't had a proper Cardinal Quest for so long. I think if we keep the chat short and elaborate on it later, it will be fine.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I agree. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We've never been there before, let's gather some information.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">The inn lady said the cave has two entrances. This is the key for the west entrance. She said the entrance probably has a sign. It can't be that hard.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So the inn lady has never been there?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Probably not. But it is not like the key is fake. People go their with the key and comes back. She keeps the keys.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's ask someone who had actually been there.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Tanya found a sailor who had been there. He confirmed that that was the key. However, just as the party were to head to the cave, they said, "by the way, if the key doesn't work, you need to shake it."</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Is this one of those ghetto quests?</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> The party arrived at West Shore beach, where the alleged entrance was supposed to be. There is a cave with trees in front of it.
  <msg spk="Casey">Do I see a sign?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">You don't see a sign.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Do I see a sign?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">You don't see a sign either. However, you see that across a bay where there was a giant turtle, there were at least two more caves.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Protect.</msg>
  <mbspell>The party now has Protect. </mbspell>
  <msg spk="Casey">Should we just try it? Maybe there is no sign.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">If it works we don't need to go around the turtle.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">...</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I try opening it with the key.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">The key gave out a glow as you entered. But the entrance did not open.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I shake it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">There seems to be no difference.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I use far-seeing to look around the other caves.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Tanya sees that they other caves had signs leading to elsewhere.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">By the process of elimination...</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Did I just not shake it hard enough? I shake it harder.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>James:</b> James comes to the rescue!
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Evelyn gives James the key. üôè</msg>
  <msg spk="James">James uses the key.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">The key glows, but the entrance does not open.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">James shakes the key.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">There is no observable difference. The entrance is not open.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">James shakes it as hard as he can.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">James shakes the key as hard as he can, and...</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Loses 1 stamina in his attempt. The entrance remains closed.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">Hiding his utter disappointment, James proclaims that if he shakes it any harder, the key is going to break.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I'm sorry! Thank you for helping us, we know there is another entrance, we will try that. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">I found the sign. P4 points at it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">From her vintage point, P4 could see the sign hidden behind the overgrown vegetation. The sign indicates that this is the entrance.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't think the sailor was stronger than James. Maybe he shakes it in a different way. We need a demonstration.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Long story short, the Sailor was the only one who could open the entrance with shaking. But we couldn't tell the trick to the shaking, so...
  <msg spk="Tanya">I asked the Hospitalian Knights to change the entrance.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I got what I was looking for, and found that we are missing two things, presumably somewhere at the bottom of the lake.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I suppose that would be a story for another day.</msg>

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> Other than shopping, what is our weekend plan?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Albatross quest please. We are behind putting concepts up for Albatross.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">What is our stance on this Risk boardgame that has been here for weeks?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">@Sasha? üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">It is for us to play, eventually.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't think we will play war games.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But wars are real. It even has Kiev in it. And I got it when it was on sale.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But I don't see it happening in this guild. We are a peacemaker guild. Why would we play a war game for fun?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Maybe it would be educational?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Evelyn, I see a curse affecting Sasha. Could you de-curse her?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't see what you mean. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">She got this game for some reason. She might not even know the reason, so she is making up reasons to justify her impulse. There is a curse on her.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Sasha, what do you like about this game?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Hmmm... It has cool components? These crowns, these castle cities, and different miniatures for each faction.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't quite get it. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Sasha, I think we talked about not getting games just for their components. And the majority of the components in this game are soldiers. We can't have a situation where we imagine commanding them to fight each other. That should be against guild rule.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">It is against guild rule. I put it on the 
  <msg spk="Sasha">But we played Adventure Begins. We fought there also.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">An all out war game is definitely a step in the wrong direction.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">In Adventure Begins, we were playing ourselves and it was cooperative. I don't want to play a game where we fight each other, especially when it is by sending others to fight. üôè</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Hold on there. In this game, you DON'T have to fight. You could just defend your borders against others who try to fight you. You could win by just earning crowns without attacking anyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Then it is better than I imagined. But large scale fighting is still a tragedy to imagine.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But wouldn't you want to test how peacemaking methods work if OTHERS are trying to take over the world? Shouldn't that be the end goal of the guild?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I find that argument quite compelling. If you want peace, prepare for war.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Someone gets it. I am surprised that Tanya didn't get it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Not all peacemaking guilds are the same. This is not a paladin guild. Simulation is not entertainment.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I agree with Tanya on that also.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But then how does the guild rule "If it ain't fun, change it" work? Simulation is not fun. Therefore we need to make it fun. If it is not fun thinking about how to defend the world from someone trying to take it over, then we need to make it fun thinking and preparing about.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">But this is warfare. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">No it is not. It is a war *game*. We aren't destroying any pieces. They know that it is a number and dice game. If their number is not enough. They are "defeated" and stay outside the board. No one is actually hurt unless you WISH to imagine that people are getting hurt and such. I didn't ask you to wish for that. I'm presenting you a GAME with defined game rules. If you WISH to imagine people are getting hurt, that's on you.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I find that to be a very compelling argument, if the players simply do not mention or refer to anyone being hurt.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So from this number and dice game, we can PLAY and experience the other issues such as diplomacy and alliance. It is educational.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Even if you do so, the game will not be played because we have more direct and faster ways to imagine and discuss diplomacy and alliance, than to spread a game board and move game pieces around.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That might work for you, but for some the visual aid will make the discussion more attractive and memorable.</msg>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [11:57 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Sasha:</b> At this point, if I ask you whether Adventure Begins or Risk Europe is a more relevant game for the guild, you should conclude that Risk Europe is better.
  <msg spk="Sasha">And us playing it would lead us to Arcacian Quest constantly. We will learn and grow together and it will be fun.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think Sasha's argument is compelling, especially when I am responsible for imagining suffering when there is no need.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>I'm</b> making a post at Seed of Peace about our definition of freedom. How do we want to use/define that word?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I would first define Ability. Ability means a person being able to do something. Freedom is different from Ability. Freedom means whether a person is allowed to do something without retaliation.
  <div></div><div class="". That doesn't mean they have a right to do evil. It just means no one has the means to stop or restraint them.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then in your definition, "Freedom" by itself is a neutral word. It does not imply whether a person is allowed to act or not. That would contradict with the intent behind terms such as "Freedom of Speech". That implies that the speaker is not retaliated against for speaking.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">To describe that villain, I would say, "their violation of other people's freedom is unopposed."</msg>
  <div></div><div class="". I want Liberty to mean what a person or society allows. Freedom to describe a situation to act without restrain.
  <msg spk="Black">If we make that distinction, then we can evaluate different "freedom" and refer to the ones that we subscribe as "liberty".</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I agree with that. The word "Freedom" is also used to describe evil behaviors. And yes, "free" means being unrestrained, which also means without being retaliation. But it doesn't imply that the reason is people "approve" or "allow" it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Freedom is something you can define by yourself and claims that others are violating. Liberty is not something you can define by yourself because it is given. The meaning of Liberty would be similar to "permission", except a permission is something you need to ask others to get, while liberty covers everything you are allowed to do without asking for a permission on a case by case basis.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then what is a right?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Black:</b> I think as this point I want Right to mean something that is morally right and a person shall be given the liberty to do. Liberty refers to what a person or a regime allows others or its people to do. Rights refer to what those people and regimes should allow people to do.
  <msg spk="Tanya">So when a country recognizes a right (a human right), the country would craft its laws accordingly to support it. The set of freedom allowed by law is the liberty that the country offers. If the country's legislature is outdated, the liberty it offers may be insufficient to protect a person's human rights.</msg>

  <msg spk="Sasha">What is that supposed to mean?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Unlike a company that may have employee evaluation, our guild should have nominations and recognition of guild members.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Don't we already have that? If a member wants a recognition they would just ask for one.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think that is different.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">And there is the leaderboard that shows the highest score member.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">But when you look at the leaderboard you can't tell what they are especially good at.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Is that something you want to see at a member's profile?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Maybe ?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">The quest is ill-defined XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The last time we had a nomination, it was Fina nominating posts for having the best tab style. But that was about things we make, not we ourselves.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="".
  <msg spk="Tanya">I can see that.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="" I want to see the highest scorer.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I am fine with those statistics.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree doesn't know how to do that automatically!</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">But we need that functionality. Otherwise it would be hard for people to see the fairness of the scoring.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Red, is that something you want to do?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think it can be that.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's start from the top. 3B is the highest scorer at the moment. And we know that most of her points came from drawing manga. How do we want to put that on her profile?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">As of April 17, 2022, 3B has 1424 points. 1328 of which are from Manga charter. That is more than 93% of her score!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So I would put "Score Leader of CH 12 @Manga." This recognition is unlikely to change anytime soon.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">What you said is correct, but that's not what StarTree said. StarTree said 3B got 93% of her score from @Manga, not that 3B contributed 93% of the scores of @Manga.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Ok. My bad.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree does not know how to tally the highest scorer for each charter because a scoring row could have more than one participant!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I don't think we need to be that accurate.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it is less about accuracy but automation. Accuracy would come as a bonus if we enable automation.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">I am fine with what Ledia would put for 3B. I want to know Tanya's score distribution.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Of Tanya's 992 points: 379 are from Cardinal Field Log. 366 from Guild Log, and 217 from Daily Log! Tanya's 366 points Guild Log scores distribution is: Concept 111, Board 77, Guild 45, Cardinal 32, Whale 31, Vacation 23, Seed 9, Skill 8, Paladin 6, Wish 6, Freedom 4, Music 4, Puzzle 3, Happy 2, Treasure 2, Arena 1, Dream 1, Makeover 1</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That looks like a quite balanced distribution. Is Tanya the score leader of @Concept?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">The top scores of @Concept are Tanya 111, LRRH 95, Zoey 23, Fina 19, Vivi 12</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I would put Tanya is a contributor in many areas and the score leader for Cardinal Quest and CH 16 @Concept.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">I don't care how Tanya's score compares to other members. I just want to know where she got credits.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">An audit column is now added to the charter list in Google Sheets!</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">I want that information to be available at the profile so people don't have to go to Google Sheets.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I am okay with the kind of information Ledia puts. More detail is fine also.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Who's third?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Evelyn is third!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I... I'm third? üò≥</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Evelyn passed StarTree TODAY and becomes the third highest scorer in the guild! üéâüéâüéâ
  <msg spk="LRRH">Congratulations!</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">And what are her scores?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Cardinal Field Log 274</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">I'm fine if you just copy and paste that to her profile.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That is super dry. I think it should be hidden behind a click.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Is Evelyn the score leader of @Happy?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Yes she is! And she is leader of receiving Arcacian awards in Daily Log!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Every time I sing I get Arcacian award. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">When you sing during Cardinal Quest, you get 5 points. 1 in the Field log, 1 in the Daily log for singing, and 3 for Arcacian Award. 3B gets 5 points for drawing and translating a page of manga. It took her hours. But singing only takes a minute.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I can't tell if it is fair or not üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">We need bards during the quest for mana regen.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't see a compelling reason to adjust the scores. We don't get many points for discussing. We get points for generating and presenting ideas. We are not awarding points based on effort but on need. If we discover how to better use 3B's manga, then 3B can get more points.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But we are using avatars that 3B draw every day.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So are most of the concepts that we define.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I also don't have a compelling argument.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Red, does this take care of the Guild Quest?
  <msg spk="LRRH">Maybe ?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">You can't clear the quest when the quest objective is undefined XD</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Is it okay if we just do three of them?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I would just update it as part of @Makeover.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> If A has housing but B doesn't, when A needs to give housing to B, then A should give B the size of their largest bedroom.

  <msg spk="Zoey">Then why just the bedroom? Why not their largest plot of extra land?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> We need to know what is essential to tell what is extra.

  <msg spk="Tanya">So Casey's method won't work for a continuous large space. People would just argue that none of them has acquire enough essential space, so no one needs to share anything.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Essential space should have enough space for a person to rest and meditate, with access to natural clues for they circadian physiology.

  <msg spk="Tanya">That would include protective equipment, and clothing.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Should essential dwelling include a restroom and kitchen?
  <msg spk="Tanya">That doesn't seem essential unless a person is diseased.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">According to universal precautions, you would assume everyone else is diseased. So a person dwelling should allow them enough space to shelter in place with personal protective equipment off.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">How long should they be allowed to shelter in place?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">it would depend on the local threat. If we just consider quarantine, maybe 2 weeks. This means people don't need to go elsewhere for quarantine. They may self quarantine.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>Is</b> moral compass necessary in discussing policies?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> If you propose a policy, you should have evaluated whether it is morally sound. And if possible you should also evaluate its effect and impact.
  <msg spk="Tanya">So if you propose a policy, it is fair if others ask you to show that it is morally sound. If you cannot show that, then you haven't done the prerequisite due diligent for others to pay attention.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then you are not proposing a policy, but asking for help in evaluating your policy.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> What about the argument where people with different moral compass may still agree on the same policy, so it is not necessary to talk about moral compass in the discussion?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then you are describing a case where no one happens to question the moral validity of the policy. If no one questions the validity and no one shows its validity, then the discussion group is at risk of Group Think.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">They are at risk to be ALL WRONG together because they didn't vet the policy at something fundamental.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That is surely one way for a group to end up deciding to do something morally wrong.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> What about the argument that even if you know that your proposal is morally sound, in order to get acceptance, you would present it the way the opposition believe would benefit them.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't think one could normally pull that off because people are opposed to changes. People can quiet easily tell or form an opinion on how a change would impact them in the short term and oppose it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So if you just give them short term benefits with strings attached, you could potentially wait until they get used to the benefit and are willing to compromise to keep the benefit.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <msg spk="Tanya">For Arcacian credits, people would say that is taxation through inflation. They would say those credits have no value because one would need a lot of them to trade for something, if there is anything that they may get with it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">We don't need to spend Arcacian points for day-to-day things, because the provider get credits.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct, as in the case of sustainable abundance. People are helping each other and don't have to worry about whether they have enough credits to get what they want.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Is Arcacian economy a type of gift economy?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes, as opposed to transactional economy. But not all gift economies are Arcacian. Arcacian has the requirement of helping. And you can't define helping without define what moral compass is in use.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> How do we counter the perception that if someone talks about moral, they must believe that there is only one moral compass?
  <msg spk="Tanya">That is just wrong. People with different moral compass can discuss the differences and identify what policies would fit both compasses.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> What is the difference between Moral View and Moral Compass?
  <msg spk="Tanya">A Moral Compass is a rule or a set of rules that helps a person test whether something is morally right.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">A Moral View is more fuzzy and general notion about what is good or bad, but without the precise guidance.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">A Moral Compass is a test to help a person determine objectively whether an action violates a Moral View.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> In what moral view would people discuss/draft policy by starting with moral check?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Hospitalian Knights do that. It is part of the legislative process. Each law must be grounded in protecting basic rights. If you can't connect the law to it, then there shouldn't be a law about it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What about dress code? How does that tie to protecting basic rights?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The dress code is not a law. It is part of a Guild's code of conduct.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">There is no Hospitalian law saying that a guild member needs to adhere to the guild's dress code, and there is no law saying that a guild can't require its members to follow the dress code. There is no laws about it because having such laws would violate freedom of association, since an entity is free to define its code of conduct, and individuals are free to join. No one needs to join a guild.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Why is the requirement for the Law different from guild code of conduct?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The law is about when a person may act in defense of someone's rights. Those actions would normally be disallowed if someone's right was not violated. The Laws are all for defining when the Paladins can mobilize and use force to right the wrongs.
  <button class="">‚≠ê</button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Violating a guild's dress code is not a situation that warrants Paladin deployment.</hide>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Exactly. There is no dress code law. *Look at me*</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Ledia is not in Hospitalian Knights.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That's correct. I am in Arx. That's a different guild.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Okay. I wrote  about it. Is this correct?
  <msg spk="Tanya">According to that, Arcacianism does not recognized self-help. Forbidding someone from helping themself is not a moral violation?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">That's is not what Arcacian principle means.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="", except in Arcacian terminology, no one is ever alone. You are always with your better self and Arcacia is with you.
  <mbaa>Little Red Riding Hood receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="LRRH">In Arcacianism, there are no singular persons. Every person is a plurality.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">So please change the wording. You can "help yourself" in Arcacianism and others shall not stop you from helping yourself.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>It</b> was postulated that in addition to Protect against physical attacks, which would be classified as a Paladin skill, there is a also a Cleric class Protect. Do you agree? Do you see a difference?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Evelyn:</b> The Cleric peacemaker archetype is makes peace by mediating ideological conflicts. The Cleric Protect skill lets people with conflicts to discuss peacefully and find constructive solutions and agreements.
  <msg spk="Ivy">And how do you cast that spell?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I would keep the discussion oriented in addressing the problem, highlighting common values, avoid accusation tone, let people feel welcomed as a contributor.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Could you give an example of each?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is difficult to imagine examples... üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>LRRH:</b> Say someone is petitioning for the city to rezone a piece of farmland for business because the petitioners don't want to commute elsewhere to work.
  <msg spk="LRRH">The opposition says that it would reduce farmland and cause traffic congestion.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">How would you Protect the discussion?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> If I am the host I would start by requesting both inputs and solutions.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Mikela:</b> Hey hey hey! Let's make it fun and have a mock discussion!
  <mbspell>Mikela casts special event flare.</mbspell>
  <mbrec>Mikela is recognized as Herald.</mbrec>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> What is the purpose of the business?
  <msg spk="LRRH">It is for high tech research. Let's say it is not safe or practical to do in someone's home. They need a separate facilitate for that.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Are there are location willing to let them build?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Hmm... Yes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then what is the issue? Why can't they build there and move there?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Let's say they don't want to move because they grew up here.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If they build locally, they would need to reimburse the other local people for the impact they cause.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">But they are doing the research for everyone. Why do they need to leave? Isn't there a Stewardism rule that local should take care of them?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">High tech research doesn't necessarily benefit the local.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">What if they do? But the other local wants to exploit them by kicking them out so they don't need to bear the congestion during the research, which will benefit them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">That doesn't explain why they would refuse to move when another location already wants them there.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> The purpose of this discussion is not to actually find a solution, but to demonstrate what Cleric Protect is.
  <msg spk="Ivy">So please be mean and attack each other.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Little Red Riding Hood doesn't want to be mean because that's not CUTE!</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">It is more like you CAN'T be mean because you have no moral ground in this argument. You are at the mercy of the local letting you be there because you aren't willing to compensate them for the lost of environment and convenience. You are trying to sneak by without paying your fair costs.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">But I'm doing research that will benefit you.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Not unless I ask for it. You can't show up to someone saying you will clean their house then demand you have a right to the house unless they let you clean it.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">But the result of the research is informational. Once it is out you would get the benefit for free.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then come back when it is out and when I am using it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I thought Stewardism doesn't have a concept of intellectual property.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">It doesn't. That's why I can use the tech without paying royalties</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But you are saying that if you use it, then Red has a right to live there.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">That's not about intellectual property rights. That is for her being an intellectual contributor to local Stewardship.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Each location would rank how much that contribution mattered.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Something is off but I can't pin point it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> In Stewardism, who has a right to decide whether the facility can be built?
  <msg spk="Fina">It is not about authority but sustainability. When there are not farmland available for the facility, there is no reason for the researchers to convert the farmland. Their request out of their convenience is unreasonable.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">To pay for the decrease in sustainability, they would have to pay it back in sustainability, which means coming up with another piece of farmland.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If they can't create farmland, then they cannot afford to take away farmland. They are at the mercy of caretakers taking up their slack.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">What if there is too much farmland?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">In Stewardism, too much means reducing farmland would increase sustainability. But that's not the case here because there is an alternate site for the facility.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">What about the commute?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">They can move near the facility that they will build.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">I can't find a problem.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">But the exercise is failing because we couldn't demonstrate what Cleric Protect is.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> In conclusion, it seems that we reached an understanding that without adding back farmland, building at the non-farming site is the most sustainable option. The researchers might need to leave the local town to avoid commuting, but their successful result would grant them a right to live in any community their research benefits.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ledia:</b> It seems the researchers are getting a bad deal. Even their research benefits every community by a small amount, they would end up having not enough credits in each community to get a place to live. Then they are just being exiled.
  <msg spk="Fina">If the research is worthwhile, they should have enough credits to live in many places, because once a community have taken care of caretakers, the remaining living space is prioritized based on total credits, that's when a small benefit to many people counts.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">But no matter how many total credits they have, they can't display people who are physically taking care of the location day to day. That's the bottom line.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Okay. That sounds like a fair tradeoff.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I added Cleric Protect at @Skill. But I don't feel that I can recognize anyone to have that skill until it is used.
  <msg spk="Ivy">If you see it in use please nominate for recognition.</msg>

  <msg spk="Tanya">Bullying is considered anti-autonomy because it attacks a person right to be at public places.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Therefore, if Elon Musk claims that Twitter is a de facto public town square, then either he protects people from being bullied, or Twitter is not to be treated as a public town square.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Publicly legal speech does not include those that harm autonomy of others, unless it is done to protect autonomy in response to oppressions.
  <msg spk="Tanya">There is no Hospitalian law that says every thing spoken is protected.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">And remember that Hospitalianism is an Oracle based world view. Words are the most powerful things, as spoken by Oracles.</msg>

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>This</b> is Tanya calling for players for Forest Bazaar Quest. Takers please report to the quest channel.
  <msg spk="Ledia">I'll join.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">And me.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I hope I can help.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I'll join. Since nothing else is going on... So, what is the quest.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Last month April 2nd, Evelyn asked about the area crystal of the Bazaar after seeing that another crystal scroll has spell we didn't plan to include.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I decided that it was irrelevant and asked her to move on.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I am asking the heroes for a double check on whether those magic spells were in fact necessary.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> How did you tell that those spells were irrelevant the first time?
  <msg spk="Tanya">As you many know, the new Deer Crossing statue crystals combines the magic spells of statues from two other regions: A and B.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The Forest Bazaar spells came from region A. And we did not include the magic spells about the Bazaar from region B crystal.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The question is, should those region B spells be included in Deer Crossing?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think we should know what those spells do.
  <msg spk="Sasha">I don't get it. If they weren't there in the first place. Why do we need to know what they do?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's like saying Puppy A was living in House A, when we move from house A to House D, we moved everything from A for the Puppy. Why do we need to know what is in House B?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That was my logic. If that logic is correct, then it is correct that the items remaining in House B are unnecessary.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The quest is to confirm what were left in House B. It may seem unnecessary. But that's why it is double-checking.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it is better to verify. If somehow we were wrong, then there will be a huge spawn point left unsealed. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I just want to play something, I'm fine if it is fun.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Do we agree with Zoey's plant to find the purpose of those spells? If so, let's teleport to Cat Island.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It's official! That island is called Cat Island! XD</msg>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [12:56 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div class=""><b>Cat Island</b></div>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> CUTE!!! üòç
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> In case we can't show the map, the Cat Island is on the opposite side across the sea of World Tree. It has the shape of a cat reaching for another island, the Yarn Island.
  <msg spk="Zoey">By the way, I took a sight-seeing map so we could mark on it.</msg>
  <mbspell>Zoey gains 1 EXP.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I know we normally don't announce when someone gets EXP. But I think we should do that for Cardinal Quest when we play it like this.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I already got one EXP for calling for a party.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Just to be clear, I won't get EXP if I just take another map right?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">No, we only need one. You get EXP for making progress for the quest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">According to the old notes, the spells in questions are at booths 60, 62, and 69.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Are we splitting up or going together?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Let's go together. Protect.</msg>
  <mbspell>Evelyn casts Protect and gains 1 EXP.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I'll stop announcing when everyone has gotten EXP.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I want to try on the first one. May I see the map?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">@StarTree, could you show the area map of the other region where we took spells from? The dog island map?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">There is no dog island! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">For the sake of this quest let's call that the Dog Island.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Here it is!
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Ledia, what are you checking?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I am checking whether they share any monster type.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That's not possible because a region can only have one crystal.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">It is possible because if a region starts to get cat island monsters, then it will need spells from cat island crystal. Then you might see it listed on both field monster guides.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Is that possible? ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It is possible, but very rare, almost never or factually never happened.</msg>
  <mbspell>Ledia compares the monster lists and finds no overlap. Ledia gains 1 EXP.</mbspell>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I know this is probably a detour, but I have a question... üòÖ
  <msg spk="Evelyn">If you look at the dates when the crystals were applied, you see that somehow they go back and forth between the years.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">The Cat crystal is applied in 2019 and 2021. The Dog crystal is applied in 2019 and 2020.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That's not what date when it was applied. That's the date the region was incorporated.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The Cat crystal was first applied in 2020 to those 6 regions. The Dog crystal was first applied in 2019 for 9 regions, then in 2020 unapplied in two of them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Thank you for explaining. üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I am just going to look at booth 69 directly and see what it does. If we are lucky, then we can tell right away whether it is relevant.
  <mbspell>Sasha opens the spell section for node 69. Sasha gains 1 EXP.</mbspell>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> 36 furball monsters has appeared around Sasha.
  <msg spk="Sasha">I look at the first one closest to me. What do I see?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">You see that the first furball is drifting toward a light pole.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">What do I see about the light pole?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">You see that the light pole is a scratch pole.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I judge spell 69 is irrelevant because Deer Crossing doesn't have scratch poles.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Very convincing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Any objection?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I agree.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't want to decide just yet. Let's see the next spell.</msg>
  <mbspell>Sasha opens Section 62. There are 3 spells.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I open the first one.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">41 foxtail monsters appeared around the party, waving and beating on the ground.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Foxtail is common but I don't think Deer Crossing has this attraction.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What spell did we take from this crystal? üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We took Wisp Circle and Rock Golem spells.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Let's see the second one.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">You see a spell that normally provides ladder for climbing is disabled at all but one region.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Presumably because the cats can climb by themselves?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Are we checking or are we just convincing ourselves that they are irrelevant? How do we know instead of guessing?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">We know that there are cats here. But these spells are still about the Bazaar.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">What is your point? Other dog places have bazaars too. And they don't have these spells. We are just confirming what we already know.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But how are we confirming? It seems to me that we are just making up explanations to support our pre conception that we don't need them.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I discovered that the Deer Crossing crystal already has Spell 69. It is already active by default.
  <msg spk="Ledia">I'll take that as the definite answer. We don't care because there is no difference.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">That's reassuring! üòÉ</msg>
  <mbspell>Tanya closes the case for Spell 69.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Can we say the same about Page 62 spells?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The spells on page 62 are also in Deer Crossing crystal. Same as Page 60.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">All of those spells are already in Deer Crossing crystal. But the cat crystal activates them, the dog crystal does not.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then we are back to the same conclusion. Since the previous dog region crystal do not activate them, therefore we don't need to activate them for Deer Crossing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">But we found that if they are needed, we could just activate them. That's reassuring. üôÇ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">How do we know that Deer Crossing is more like a dog island and not the cat island?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We were told to use Dog Island as the reference. But Dog Island didn't Wisp Circle and Rock Golem spells.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Hmm... So for Wisp Circle and Rock Golem you copied from Cat island. But Cat Island's Bazaar activates more spells.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Logically we would ignore those differences because we came only for Wisp Circle and Rock Golem. IDK XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">We now know that cat island's bazaar has a scratch pole. That is not at dog island. If we can tie those function to the scratch pole, then it should be a second way to confirm that they are not needed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I can connect spell 69 and the last spell of 62 to the scratch pole.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I can't think of anything further we could do about it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then are we done with this quest? @Evelyn, @Tanya?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I am convinced that even if we are wrong, the risk is much lower because it is easy to activate them if needed. So I will close this quest. Thank you for coming.

  <div class=""><b>What</b> is a correct protocol for online anonymous voting that would support choice democracy?
  <msg spk="Tanya">How do you make online anonymous voting trustworthy and auditable?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> We know how anonymous voting works in real life. Is it that different if it is online? ü§î
  <msg spk="Evelyn">In real life, anonymous voting doesn't mean that you don't know who the voters are. You may know who they are, so you also know the total number of voters.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">When they vote, each voter gets a serialized but shuffled ballot. Each voter keeps their receipt with the serial number that they don't need to show anyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Then the votes are counted by a computer and the result of all ballots are displayed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Everyone can see what each serial number voted, therefore, if they want they may tally the vote themselves.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Since each person can verify that the display is showing their own vote correctly. If no one objects, they can assume that all votes are counted correctly.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">And the result is that everyone can see how each serialized voter voted, but not know which person each serial number represent, yet they can trust that there are no extra voter and no ballot is ignored.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Wouldn't that expose everyone's address?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> If a voter needs to be a local resident to be eligible, then on the voter's profile, they could self-declare why they are eligible, and have other voters witness or endorse their truthfulness.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> What if some fraudulent voters form a ring that endorses each other?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I think an algorithm can detect those reference loops, and give a rating of isolation in general.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> How do you recover if a hack hijacks your account so you can't change your vote?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Since you have the physical receipt, you can prove that you are the voter. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> But if you do so, people will know what you voted from the record. Then you as the victim is no longer anonymous.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Then I don't know. üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> They way it can work is that the system just keeps track and display the voter serial numbers that object their own results. Unless the number of objections would affect the outcome, nothing needs to be done.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> How do you object the result of another voter when you believe that they have falsified their eligibility declaration?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Accusations about the identity and eligibility of voters would be done at the open roster section. That is not anonymous.
  <msg spk="Ledia">That's all the questions I could think of.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">@Zoey, could you make a post at Seed of Peace about this method?</msg>

  <div class=""><b>This</b> topic is as current as it gets. The US supreme court will be deciding whether abortion violates the US Constitution. For this thread, we are not trying to tell whether it violates US Constitution, but what Stewardism, Hospitalianism, or Arcacianism, or your belief, says about it.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> I think one of the bottom lineis that forcing someone to take care of a dependent would violate the carer's autonomy. This means society can't force someone to remain pregnant.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> But can they kill it? I think that is the question. And if they can't, that could be another bottom line.
  <msg spk="Black">My intuition is that a person has no rights to kill an unborn if someone else is willing to take custody.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">If no one is willing or able to take custody, then the carrier may choose to abort.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">The situation would be the same regarding someone on life-support. If no one else is willing to sustain the life-support, the current support may choose to end their support.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I'm going to say the easy answer first. In Arcacianism, helping someone give birth and taking care of their kids are credit worthy.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> What about helping someone get an abortion?
  <msg spk="LRRH">Helping the unborn become independent is credit worthy. I can't tell about abortion.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> In Arcacianism, helping is only defined when the parties agree. We don't know what the unborn is thinking. So a doctor helping someone gets an abortion would not qualify for Arcacian credits.
  <msg spk="Tanya">But a doctor who helps a terminally ill patient commit suicide would.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Hold on, wouldn't that mean Paladins don't get Arcacian credits for fighting intruders? The intruders don't agree to be resisted.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> In Stewardism, you have a right to fight back and protect each other. We don't care about Arcacian credits.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then in Stewardism, does a person have a right to fight for the unborn?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">How about I just tell you what happens if someone doesn't want to carry a baby in Stewardism?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If you don't want to carry a baby, you ask if someone else wants it instead. If so, we do a teleport transfer.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If no one wants to have it, then you may kill it because no one can force anyone to take care of anything.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I thought Stewardism would make people clean up their own mess.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If you pollute then you lose your right to partake. You lose your share of the world. If you can't stop polluting you can be killed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What if there is no teleport transfer?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">You can't force a person to go through childbirth. That is their choice.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> If I am in a dragon's grip, wouldn't Stewardism allow anyone to attack the dragon to save me? Even when doing so would mean forcing the dragon to release?
  <msg spk="Fina">Not if you are sucking the dragon's blood like a leech.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I hope that we don't go further in that direction... üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">But if you have a parasite, others don't have a right to attack you to save it, or force you to be its host, no?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If you neglect that, you have no rights to kill germs or predators.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">If you have the right to kill them, then why do you need to ask if someone would take it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Actually you would if you can identify that the predator is something special. Otherwise, if it is a common predator, you don't need to ask. You can assume that if someone wants them as pets they could just go get their own.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But in that case, it would mean that it is not the law that you need to ask if someone wants it. You could choose not to.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">It is not a law. You could just do it without telling anyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">In that case would you say abortion is a right? If you would classify an unborn to be the same as a parasite, then you would, right?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">It is one way to put that. Yes. The carrier may protect themself, that is part of their self-care.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Does it matter whether they created the unborn? It doesn't sound right if you could create something with feelings then kill it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then you are saying that if you made something evil you can't kill it by yourself? A good being would not demand to be born. It would let the carrier decide. Otherwise it is a slaver, that is evil. Anything the demands to be nourished is violating the provider's autonomy. Therefore the provider may reciprocate by violating their autonomy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Everyone basically starts Evil if you believe that the unborn *demands* to be born. Otherwise, you agree that the unborn only *hopes* to be born but lets the mother decides.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">So, in either case, the mother can decide.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That's somewhat compelling. But brutal.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">So if you believe that your unborn is kind, and the technology is there for it to be transferred, then you would ask if someone else wants it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If you believe that it is evil, you have the evidence and the right to kill it. No one else has the evidence or a right to tell you that it is not evil.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What if your mother says she felt that you were evil but chose to give birth anyway. So if you believe that the baby you carry is evil but not give birth, then you don't deserve to be born?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">But she did choose to give birth. She may blame herself.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Can she kill you now?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">For what? If she believes that she should have exercised her right to kill something evil, then why would she stop me for doing what she wished to do. I would be her redemption.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But reciprocation would allow her to kill you, right?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">But I am born and no longer a parasite. If I am trying to kill a parasite, others cannot reciprocate unless I am also a parasite.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I feel that there is a loophole if you can't hold someone accountable for what they did.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think a grown person is practically a new person compared to when they did not have free will.
  <msg spk="Ledia">That doesn't change my question. If your life was spared, and later you decide not to spare someone else's life. Do others have a right to take your life now, knowing that in the same situation you would not have spared your own life?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">In Hospitalianism, the answer is no. There was no deception when they spared you at first. There was no contract that you need to save someone else's life in the future. Even if there is such contract, in Hospitalianism it is not enforceable because that would violate your free will.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What about reciprocation?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Reciprocation just says you may treat others the way they treat others. If I don't spare the life of someone evil, then you don't need to spare me if I am evil. But if I am not being evil and I am not being a dependent, you don't have a situation to choose not to spare me.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But can people travel back in time to the moment where you were being spared and change their mind?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That's a huge can of worms. Traveling back in time to change a timeline would cause huge collateral damages. You could however create a branch. But I hope we stay on the topic of abortion.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Okay then. What is the Hospitalian view on abortion?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> In Hospitalianism, each country is allowed to decide whether it permits abortion. Country territory is adjusted according to migration.
  <msg spk="Ledia">So you are saying, If a country legalizes slavery, then the Hospitalian Knights may intervene and free the slaves.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But when a woman tries to get an abortion, the Hospitalian Knights cannot intervene ?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Why is slavery an oppression, but abortion is not?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Forced pregnancy is slavery, and oppression. If a country forbids abortion and forbids pregnant women from leaving to get an abortion, the Hospitalian Knights can intervene.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Clarification: The Hospitalian Knights can intervene if a country keeps anyone from leaving. It has nothing to do with abortion.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But in the case of abortion, the woman is leaving in order to kill someone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Gladiatorial countries are legal as long as the participants are willing. It is not illegal to try to leave a country to kill someone. Paladins do that all the time. But it is legal for a country to have a border that keeps killers out.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">A murderer cannot be prevented from exiting a border, but they can be hunted down if they are trying to hunt innocent targets.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So is abortion a right or not?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">In the typical meaning of the word, no. It is something that each country is allowed to decide. A person has a right to leave their country. Leaving is a viable choice in Hospitalianism because the borders are adjusted with net migration.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">There will be communities that allow abortion and those that do not. Both types may legally exist in Hospitalianism. It is illegal to force a community to allow or disallow abortion.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What about the unborn's right to leave the custody of the mother?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The Hospitalian Knights do not assume that the unborn wants to leave. Therefore intrusion is not justified.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">You are saying that even if you know that the mother wants to kill the unborn, you cannot assume that the unborn doesn't want to be killed?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I said leaving. We can assume that the unborn doesn't want to be killed. We can't assume that the unborn wants to leave.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The Hospitalian Knights can't enter a country to extract people who do not want to leave.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But the natural progression is that the baby will come out.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That doesn't mean that the baby wants to come out. You could interpret that as the women's body wants it out</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it is more natural to argue that the unborn wants to be born. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Why? I think it is more natural to argue that the unborn wants to be taken care of. Even if it was born, it demands attention and nourishment. It behaves like a little tyrant and terrorist. That is the exact type of people Hospitalian Laws were designed to eliminate.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It was only by the mercy and tolerance of others that such tyrants are allowed to stay put.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Parasites... terrorists... üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">In Hospitalianism, a citizen does not have a default right to be taken care of. But they have a right to leave and go to another country that offers more amenities and liberties.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Therefore, if the Hospitalian Knights were to allow to stop people from having abortions, then those who want to have an abortion would have nowhere to go to counter enslavement by the unborn.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It all comes down to who is enslaving whom in the mother-unborn relationship. I don't think there is any dispute that it is the unborn who is enslaving the mother.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Hospitalianism allows countries to make their appeal and attract immigrants.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">The baby is the slave driver...</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Anyone wants to elaborate on what Arcacianism thinks about abortion?
  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't think Arcacianism says much about it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think it would reach the same conclusion as Hospitalianism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">If you see an unborn as a parasite, then you would let a doctor help the mother get rid of it, and also help anyone who wants to be the unborn's carrier.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">If you are the mother and don't want the unborn, but someone else wants to carrier it, then in Arcacianism, you would let them help by carrying it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">It would be against Arcacian value to kill it instead if someone offer to help.</msg>
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Zoey">In this whole thread only Ledia got the award XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I guess Red fell short of pointing out that abortion is not a right in Arcacianism when someone could help.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Can we say that in Arcacianism, a person does not have a right to refuse help?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Helping and being helped are choices. Arcacianism is a guideline, not about rights.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Not acting according to Arcacian value doesn't mean that you are violating someone's rights.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>Anyone</b> has any wish they want to make?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think we don't have time to make wishes. Arsenal is getting out of control.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Is it okay if I wish that Arsenal will be easier than we expect? üòÖ
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> I wish that it is less like gambling.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> What do you mean by gambling?
  <msg spk="Black">We don't set the deadlines, but we are expected to deliver by the deadlines.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But I thought they did ask for estimations.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">The estimations are unrealistic. It would be more honest if instead of promising a deadline, we simply reflect an expected completion date and give status reports.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Do you want a different quest?
  <msg spk="Black">Yes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Wouldn't it help if you know you are on track?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">But we don't have time to map it out. And I think if you map it out, you would just see that it can't be done.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">It is, "Do you want to spend a few days mapping out the future and delay what you need to do now?" There is no time left for my autonomy to decide what to do.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ledia:</b> But IF we map it out and it looks doable, then there won't be anxiety everyday. Correct?
  <msg spk="Black">If it shows that it is doable then yes, it would be reassuring.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Tanya, could you make a quick and simple map?
  <msg spk="Tanya">I can make a highly inaccurate map.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Let's start with that.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The current deadline of Arsenal is June 17, which is about 30 weekdays away. With 47 spawn points, we need to seal 1.6 spawn points per day.
  <msg spk="Tanya">But we don't even have 30 weekdays. We have about 20 left if we also try to do the Pylon quest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So it is 2.4 spawn points we need to seal per weekday.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think our actual speed is way lower than that. Maybe a little less than 0.5 spawn points per day.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">@StarTree, can you fact check that?</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>StarTree:</b> According to the field log, Deer Crossing took 340 hours for 18 spawn points, that is 0.42 spawn points per day!
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Tanya is pretty accurate. üòÉ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But 0.42 per day means we need 112 days. But we only have 20 days.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">StarTree, could you re-calculate with only the time for the first statue?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Then it took 288 hours, which is 0.5 spawn points per day!</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That's still 94 days instead of 20 days.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">In terms of weekdays, that is more than 3 months behind.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Is this reassuring?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sylvia:</b> I thought the spawn points in the gem mines would be easier to seal.
  <msg spk="Tanya">We don't know that for sure because we have not done them. But we know that some of them are difficult.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sylvia">If all of those spawn points are gone, is the rest doable?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">18 spawn points are outside the mines, so 36 days!</msg>
  <msg spk="Sylvia">But not all of them need Crystal work.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">We are getting more and more back to the realm of wishful thinking.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The aggregated average includes the time we needed to work on non Crystal works.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So the current estimate is that even if there is a gem expert handling all the gem spawn points, we are still off by 16 days.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Not to mention that the hours StarTree got are solid hours, not turnaround time. That's the time we need if we only work on Arsenal.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> So if we look at the rough estimate, it says that we can't make it. What can we do?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> It seems that Cardinal Quest needs to be Tier 1 again, and all other quests should be Tier 3.
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think we can get a more accurate estimate if start doing it.</msg>
  <mbspell>Evelyn prays for Easy Mode.</mbspell>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We need help on this.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Are we keeping Pylon quest? Are we dropping it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's wait for the meeting tomorrow.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>What</b> is a good place to present debates and arguments?
  <msg spk="Tanya">The Albatross was the designated place, but Seed of Peace is so flowery. The content doesn't seem to fit.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If the content won't fit, should it not be presented, or should it be presented elsewhere?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think Seed of Peace still needs a definition of Capitalism.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Hopefully one that is more mainstream. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't think there is a peaceful definition of capitalism.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Can we start by defining what an unregulated market is?
  <msg spk="Tanya">An unregulated market is a market free from control outside the decisions of the market participants, meaning the buyers and sellers.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">And what is the range of regulations in that context?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The regulations include who may participate, the prices, what can be sold, what people may possess, where, when and how a trade may happen.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Is it correct that in an unregulated market, a person can sell themself?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That is correct.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Objection. Why did you say that market regulation includes what people may possess? Possession is different from trading.
  <msg spk="Tanya">If market regulation does not include what a person may possess, what do you want to call the type of regulation that defines what a person may possess?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Property Laws.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then according to you, an unregulated market could exist within a society with property laws. Correct?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Correct.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">And the said property law could define that a person owns themself as their property, but says nothing about whether they may sell it, correct?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Correct. So if the property law does not define a person as a piece of property, then even in an unregulated market it cannot be traded.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">In an unregulated market, a person can attempt to trade anything, including things they do not possess. It is up to the buyer buying it. It ignores possession laws.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">What do you mean?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It means that if I just write a deed for Magic Bakery, I can try to sell it. And people can try to buy it. Whether Magic Bakery lets the buyer controls it is a separate matter.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">An unregulated market allows that transaction to take place. It is a buyer be ware situation. A transaction doesn't imply that the buyer will get what they think they will get.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">... ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That sounds about right.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> For example, when Red encounters someone who doesn't realize that an unregulated market implies people can be sold, she could link to Albatross, which will do the explanation.
  <msg spk="Tanya">That is the intended use of the Albatross. The question is, can Seed of Peace handle such content?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Let me add the definition of unregulated market first.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Okay. Done. Back to the question of where could Red link to that would explain what an unregulated market implies.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Can you imagine how that content would be okay? You will pick a picture for it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think I will pick the picture of dirt. Just give me the argument and I will post it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Okay.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> An unregulated market implies a person may sell themself to a willing buyer. Once that happens, Capitalism allows the owner to control all aspects of the sold person, and gains ownership of everything they make including their offspring.
  <msg spk="Ledia">That's what can happen. But now you have to define Capitalism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I would define that to include this meaning: the owner of a means of production owns the product. But this is just one ideology of capitalism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That's enough for what matters.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I have a question: Why are we trying to tell people about this?
  <msg spk="Tanya">People should know how dangerous their concepts are when they try to promote it. People who wants capitalism with an unregulated market opens a quick way to slavery.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Actually I would think an unregulated is part of the ideologies of capitalism. So capitalism by itself opens a quick way to slavery.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">You still need the original person who is willing to be a slave. But I see how that can happen so I can't argue against it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That would be part of the ingredients: An unregulated market, and a person willing to sell themself. Since we are talking about childbirth, we are really talking about an unregulated market, plus a woman willing to sell herself given her circumstance.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Capitalism only needs these two to start a bloodline of slavery, and it can create the second ingredient with the first because the parents automatically owns their kids in an unregulated market under capitalism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">As I said I think capitalism by itself already implies it wants an unregulated market.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think that is optional. And just because capitalism wants it, it doesn't mean that it would get it. An unregulated market only exists when someone fights off all the entities trying to regulate it. But if that condition happens, the rest can happen.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Would you say that capitalism needs two ingredients for slavery: An unregulated market, and either someone willing to sell themself, or to claim their child as property?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Then people will counter saying that communism only needs one ingredient for slavery: a regulated market with a rule for slavery.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That's not directly communism, that is authoritarianism. It takes more force to have a regulated market than an unregulated market.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It is easier to get an unregulated market than an regulated market. To get an unregulated market, all you need to do is to hide.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then there is a question of how a communistic society makes decision to legislate slavery</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then you need to define communism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Hold on. Let me define capitalism first.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">O...K... It sounds really negative.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But I think that is what it means.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Instead of saying "it is not immoral to...", I think it is better to say "... shall not be forbidden."</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">You might phrase that as a right in capitalism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Okay.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We are not done here. Let's continue later.</msg>

  <msg spk="Evelyn">In Arcacianism it is harder to have someone in desperation to sell themself.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Then it seems that the ingredients of slavery is the same for all ideologies, the difference is in how likely each ideology can get that ingredient.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then are we comparing how strongly each ideology forces a person to serve another?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Is being ranked at the top good or bad?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it is more intuitive if good is on top.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then it becomes some type of freedom ranking.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I would prefer phrasing that as freedom or peace ranking instead. üôÇ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That's something I can easily post at Seed of Peace.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> In such ranking, would imperialism be at or among the bottom?
  <msg spk="Ledia">Let's start with that at the bottom. After defining it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Imperialism is a concept that people exist to serve an emperor, who has a right to rule the world by conquest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I can add that.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Let's rank them as we add them. I need to make another page. What should the title be?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Peace ranking. Inside that page you could have a section of ranking of ideology.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Okay.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I ended up adding the ranking in the definition page for now. I'll split it when we have more definitions.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then please add Stewardism to the definition page.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Can't have capitalism sitting at the top of the scale.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I want to add populism between Stewardism and Capitalism.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I define populism as a moral view of deciding based on majority rule. It allows subjugation of the minority, but not the other way around.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I would rank it above capitalism because capitalism allows a minority to subjugate a majority.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">And it is ranked below Stewardism because Stewardism doesn't allow subjugation except is reciprocation.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Okay.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Next up from populism would be constitution democracy.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I would define that as having a type of democracy that asserts some rights as basic human rights, but may also include many instances where majority rule is used without any compensation to the minority.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Done.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Next I am going to say Hospitalianism is at the top, above Stewardism.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I define Hospitalianism as constitutional choice democracy applied in an international setting which uses ongoing contest of hospitality to setting international disputes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I rank it above stewardism because stewardism doesn't have a predictable way to settle disputes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">No contest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Done.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I can't tell whether Arcacianism is above or below Hospitalianism.
  <msg spk="Tanya">We can save that for next time.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>Here</b> is the idea: Instead of having a Tier system indicating what quests are important, why don't we list them with a rank system based on how many times it progresses in a month?
  <msg spk="Casey">For example, at the start of a month, every quest resets to rank 0. Then when someone does something for it, it upgrades to rank 1 and so on.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">We would set a max, such as rank 5.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> If I see that I would want every quest to be at least rank 1. üòÖ
  <msg spk="Casey">That's up to you.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> What is the reason for the change?
  <msg spk="Casey">The Tier system looks more authoritarian even if we let people do whatever quest they want.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">It is like, "How dare you rank my quest lower?"</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">A rank system would just reflect what people work on.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> We are already half way in May. So every quest that has been updated start at Rank 1 now?
  <msg spk="Casey">@StarTree can you show us the current rank?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Here is the result: Level 4: Seed. Level 3: Cardinal. Level 2: Carrot, Concept, Music. Level 1: Arena, Board, Book, Freedom, Guild, Happy, Manga, Paladin, Puzzle, Skill, Treasure, Vacation, Whale, Wish. Level 0: Makeover!
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Yes, this makes me want to do something for Mira Mira. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Nothing wrong with that.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I thought the purpose of the Tier system was so that we can concentrate on important quests.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">But you can choose to work on the one you believe is the most important.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I want to know what the guild decides to be important. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Evelyn, how about if you don't know what is important, you start a quest and ask for input? That was what I was doing when I asked for weekend plans.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Okay. I can do that.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I thought Tanya would be more against this.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I have thought about it and concluded that Arcacianism is more peaceful than Hospitalianism because Hospitalianism is based on Coexistence, while Arcacianism goes a step further to promote Cooperation.
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I was reminded of that ranking because 3B was posting her manga. She drew about it more than a year ago.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So now I am more in favor of having less directedness and having more flexibility.</msg>
  <mbkudo><b>Tanya gives kudos to 3B and Fina for having defined that scale a long time ago.</b></mbkudo>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> It seems no one is against it, so @StarTree please make the change starting tomorrow?
  <msg spk="StarTree">What is the actual heading of each rank level?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Can we use "Rank" but start with Rank D up to Rank A? Then if a quest made significant progress it will be awarded Rank S.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree's mind is blown!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">If you do that I would want to update every quest so that every quest gets an A. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think that is fine. It is Arcacian.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> So does Mira starts at Rank D? Or is it unranked?
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think untouched in the month should be "unranked".</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree understands!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Hold on. If no update is unranked, then it means it takes 80 updates for the 20 quests for all of them to be Rank A. That's almost 3 updates per day.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes. Rank A would be weekly update on average. So weekly update for all quests.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">But an update can be a small one.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Sasha, what are you worrying about? You don't even have a quest.
  <msg spk="Sasha">But if you say I can get an A then it makes me want to have a quest and get an A.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Arcacianism at work XD ü§£</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> @StarTree, could you apply the ranking starting today. I think it is better if we see it now while we are discussing.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Do we still care how long ago a quest was last updated? Am I listing them in alphabetical order in each rank?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Let's start with alphabetical order.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">It's done!</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I think it looks better than before.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it looks more like a quest board now. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Actually I never look at that because it wasn't really readable. I just look at the google sheet XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Now it looks better.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I wish that the quests on the list are clickable, so that when I click on it I can see what was last updated.
  <msg spk="StarTree">And it's done!</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Whoa, I was going to say you can't sort links because the anchor goes before the actual text.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> For @Skill, let's add concepts from Atomic Habit.
  

  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> For those who watched it, what skills are there?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Habit building?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> What archetype should it be?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Would that be Cleric? When someone trying to break a bad habit, it would be like de-cursing.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Habit building should be a Magician skill. Magician skills due to desires, cues, attraction, and rewards.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I agree with Sasha more. I think it should be a Magician skill.
  <mbrec>Ledia and Sasha are recognized to have the skill Identify Skill.</mbrec>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I feel that we are applying some of the concepts in Atomic Habit already. For example, our quest list is a cue. We are starting small, so even a small action counts for updating a quest.
  <msg spk="Zoey">The way we use quests match the concept of defining systems instead of goals.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> In that case, what habit do we want to build? What habit do we want to break?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Too much social media XD Especially during the week.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> What is the current habit?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> We go to Twitter as part of daily morning news routine.
  <msg spk="LRRH">If someone replies, we tend to respond. It is not clear whether responding makes any difference.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">But we are trying to make a difference, that's why we are building Albatross.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">So I think going to Twitter is a good habit, but doing it for too long is a bad habit.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Okay. Let's focus on breaking the habit of going to Twitter for too long.
  <msg spk="Ivy">Is it fair to say that if you need to refresh, then you have been on it for too long?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">That seems fair.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">What habit should it trigger when you need to refresh?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">How about copying a bookmark from Twitter back to Guild ?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">The bookmark list should be empty, because those are all links that should be processed in the guild.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">In that case, why not switch the order? Start Twitter by importing the bookmarks. If you are done importing the bookmarks from the previous day, then you browse.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">And in order to promote Albatross, you don't reply unless there is an Albatross link.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I am applying "make it difficult"</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">And if you don't follow the habit, Sasha may nuke you and you are KO'ed for the day.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like the KO part.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Ok.</msg>
  <mbrec>Sasha is recognized as the enforcer.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I enlist @StarTree to monitor when Red is nukable.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Roger!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Special Announcement: The guild is only two quest away from having updated ALL quests within a week!
  <msg spk="Ledia">Let's do it!</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like how StarTree makes these announcements when we are very close to an achievement. This should be a magician skill: Achievement Identification. And StarTree has it.</msg>

  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes I know. But no one is going to participate because it is a campaign.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> How about making it an efficiency habit detective?
  <msg spk="Black">If we are not going to deal with actual crimes, and want to solve some relevant puzzles, then daily efficiency would be the puzzle we need to solve.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">We just need to make something 1% better each time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">It is a promising idea.</msg>
  <mbrec>Black is recognized for the Alchemist Skill Kaizen.</mbrec>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> But I don't want that section to be Whale Clinic. I want it to be Magic Bakery Detectives.
  <msg spk="Black">That's fine. You can make a section.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So, what inefficiency do you need wisdom from the Great Detective Sasha?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> Our last fail was from... Tanya. She answered a question using outdated information. So she added a comment at the outdated document saying it was outdated.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then isn't that solved?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> No it is not solved. That was just one document I marked. Next time if someone asks about a different document, that document we look at from experience could be outdated.
  <msg spk="Tanya">We are missing a step to check for the latest document.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So you want an algorithm upgrade.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Or you could call that a protocol.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think we have a section for protocols in the field notes, although it is not very populated.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Maybe we need something easier to use.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Why don't we start something at the field notes first? We can use that space to organize our thoughts. When we see enough what is involved, then we can make it easier to use.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then let's do that first.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The notes already has a section about runes. But I think we need another section corresponding to a "Help Desk" protocol. The guide is about what to do if someone comes to our help desk and asks about runes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Adding an Inquiries Guide section.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Should I add how it failed before?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think logging failures make it more personal and memorable.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Tanya is hard working and has good work ethics.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Okay it is added.</msg>
  <mbkudo><b>Tanya thanks Black, Evelyn, LRRH and Sasha for helping on improvements.</b></mbkudo>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> This reminds me that I had a dream this morning about a puzzle. I'll post it tomorrow.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> In the meantime I am still thinking about what I want for Magic Bakery Detectives section. I might start that tomorrow.

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>Yesterday</b> I dreamed of a puzzle regarding an efficiency tradeoff between the number of people doing a task, the time it takes for them to complete it, and the risk of error.
  <msg spk="Tanya">The three attributes depend on many factor such as abilities of the people involved and difficulty of the task. It is an Oracle class problem. But this is the puzzle:</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> If a person working on a task alone can finish it task in 2 days, and working with a buddy can finish in 1.5 days. At what error rate should the task be assigned to two people?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Very interesting what kind of things Tanya dreams about.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Arcacia was the one asking that in the dream.</msg>
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Arcacian Quest received XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> When a person makes an error, does it create another task to be solved?
  <msg spk="Tanya">For now let's say yes. An error creates another task that needs 2 days to "solve" alone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">This sounds entirely a math problem.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It is, so there should be definite answers we may use as a rough guideline.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If the error rate is 1 then the task would never end XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">What if the error chance is 50%? Then... it adds up to ... 4 days to actually finish a task on average.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If you assign the task to two people, is the error rate the same or better? You would think that it is less likely to have an error.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's say the error rate will reduce to 25% of normal. So: 12.5%.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then it takes about 1.7 days to complete. It pays to not make mistakes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But we are not comparing 4 days to 1.7 days, because if you assign two people to the same task, you are forgoing having them working on two tasks.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So we are comparing 4 days versus 3.4 days. Which is still better.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> For those interested in the math, it is .
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So... are we done with this puzzle?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Almost. According to this math, there are only three important variables:</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">1) T = Time multiplier of session completion with a buddy, and;</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">2) S = The error rate when solo.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">3) B = The multiplier in error rate with a buddy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So I want to see a graph showing when having a buddy is better.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">The graph will be 3D.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">...</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Then I have a question: Suppose having a buddy does not reduce the session time, at what error rates would it still make sense to have a buddy?
  <msg spk="Sasha">Hey, this sounds like the game mechanics of 
  <msg spk="Casey">Then we are getting the educational benefit without playing the game.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">What if it has <i>more</i> interesting lessons?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Then we can find out by solving real puzzles.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Compelling reasoning.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Okay. Magic Bakery Detectives: Solving puzzles in the game of real life.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The condition equation is when having a buddy takes less over all time than soloing: 2T/(1-SB) &lt; 1/(1-S).
  <msg spk="Tanya">Solving for B gives: B &lt; (1+2TS-2T)/S.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">When T=1, it becomes B &lt; 2 - (1/S).</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">This means if the solo error rate is not more than 0.5, it won't make sense to assign a buddy if it won't make each session shorter.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So if your skill is Rank B or above for the task, then you could solo it. Or to say it the other way around:</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">If having someone tag along won't help you complete the task earlier, then you are at least Rank B at the task.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If you want to derive the skill level of a person, you just need to check their error rate. Error rate of 0.5 means Rank B. 0.25 means Rank A.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> What is our error rates?
  <msg spk="Tanya">The error rate can be calculated based on the amount of time we think we can finish a task Ts, and the total time we actually take to finish the task Tt = Ts/(1-S).</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">For example, if we think we can finish in 0.5 days, but we actually takes 2 days, then our error rate is S = (Tt-Ts)/Tt = 0.75.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">We are rank C (?) üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If we want to know our proficiency, we need to start making prediction of when we would be done for each task. Proficiency P = Ts / Tt.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Suppose we are Rank C, then it would worth having a buddy as long as we could reduce errors by 1/3, even if it takes the same time.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct. But more precisely: B &lt; (1+2TS-2T)/S. When S=0.75, B &lt; (4-2T)/3</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> But is this math helpful? Say if you are stuck at a task, you can always ask for help first. People who can't help could simply not reply. Then, as long as you ask for help early, you don't need to know what the statistics are. You should already be doing the best you can.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I agree with Sasha that asking first is generally good. We have cases where it saves us a lot of time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Heuristics over planning.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Sasha:</b> If you want to tackle the task assignment problem from the view of figuring out how many people you need to assign, there will be too many variables you don't know.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Instead, you could have broken it into small pieces and let everyone work on it at once.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">And call for help or release your task for other to do when you are stuck.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Our focus should not be in predicting how long it takes to do quests, but to help each other becoming more proficient at whatever quest they choose to do.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">If we all become more proficient, then we don't care about complicated math on how to assign teams.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">We could all solo the quests.</msg>
  <mbaa>Sasha receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Word.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think the heuristic and the math are both important. The math will help us adjust the heuristics if we have the data.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> But is this our general strategy? That we want to focus on identifying where we lack proficiency and try to improve?
  <msg spk="Ivy">Atomic Habits did say we should be content even if we assign the "right number" of people for a quest and the quest is completed as expected. It postulates that if we focus on getting better, we will get quests completed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If the math is not helpful, should we end this and switch to another quest?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think this quest helped us confirm our strategy of completing quests: we should aim to skill up so we can solo the quests, but at the same time we break down quests into soloable pieces.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">And we are Rank A at a task if we complete it leaving no spawn point unsealed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Actually that would be Rank S. You can still make 25% error at Rank A.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Sorry about my math. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I'll keep the math in mind. Discussion is adjourned. Let's move on to other quests.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">üîë</div><b>Sasha:</b> In conclusion, we started with a question on when more people are needed for a quest, and ended up with a solution of always breaking a quest into soloable pieces and help each other solo. By focusing on ourselves becoming more proficient, we could eliminate the overhead of managing or predicting who shall do what.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think in most cases, I could still try again if I fail. So my method would be (e) I try to improve until I am satisfied.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> For puzzles, if you fail you can't try again because you already know the answer. In those cases I would do (b). I learn why I didn't get it before move on to the next one, so that I don't waste the next puzzle.

  <div class=""><b>Do</b> you take notes? How does it help you? How do you do it?
  <msg spk="Black">I am asking this as part of @Whale to share effective note-taking ideas.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> The method I want to share is our field troubleshooting notes. It is a huge document that contains countermeasures and information on many situations.
  <msg spk="Black">It currently has five section: Alarms, Features, References, Tasks, Special.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">In the alarm section, topics are listed alphabetically by alarm codes. Under each are the countermeasures and history of occurrence.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> While that organization is convenient for computer issues because the computer will give an alarm code, in real life there is no alarm code.
  <msg spk="Black">If real life gives an alarm code then I can apply it to real life.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think if we simply start making a real life troubleshooting document, we could organize it into categories as we go.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I think part of the problem is that since life doesn't give alarm codes, you won't even know if something is wrong and needs to be addressed.
  <msg spk="Ivy">You need some kind of diagnostics sequence. It could be a checklist of situations that should be alarming.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> If something is not working, people will complain. You don't need to go out of the way to check.
  <msg spk="Casey">For example, we just fixed the air conditioner. If I were to categorize it, it would be under Appliances or AC.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So for a real life document, since there are no actual alarm code, we would only have the Features section where you group the issues under topics.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> Should Harbor host such troubleshooting information for the guild? Should it be a document or just html?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I still want my side panel where I could just click click click. XD
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I told you earlier that you could just use Word in web view, then you could shrink it to the size you want, and you could edit as you use it.
  <msg spk="Ivy">For the same document, you could open it twice using New Window. You can have a small one on the side and a big one as the main.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But it is difficult to make links in a Word document.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">It's not. It is just a bookmark.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> So, should we start with a document for the guild?
  <msg spk="Ivy">Yes. Because there will be information you can't post online. But you'll need that information if you were to use it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Then how do you share it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">The part that you share would be a subset.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Couldn't we just password protect it or use a secret menu?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">No one needs to know that information. That is just junk for a visitor.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">It is junk for them, not for us. They don't have to click on it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">This is about anonymity. If you want to talk about it, please make a new topic.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I've an idea, for local information that matters, we could just keep it physically at a local place.
  <msg spk="Ivy">You mean like making post-it next to the AC?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Hmm... yes, or with permanent marker?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Then if you want to check something you need to physically go to places and open closets. I think just having a central document with everything is better. Then you can see and check everything without moving.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">You're right.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> If we make such document, what should it be called?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Master Notes, or just "Master". And put it at the root of the directory.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then when something breaks you can say "Go check the Master" XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Right now since we already put appliance receipts in a folder, the notes about them are in the same folder.
  <msg spk="Casey">If we make a master, do we delete the notes in the folders?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">This is like Ledia's idea, but virtual.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think each person has a difference preference on how they take notes. So the person who wants everything in a Master could copy information elsewhere there, without deleting the file in the folder.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I feel like at this point you are trying to improve something that does not have a demand for it to be improved. You don't have the volume of issues you need to deal with to justify a change.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> But it bothers me that there is no Master document at the root of our local directory explaining where things are or how the directory is organized.
  <msg spk="Black">That I agree.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> @StarTree, please make a Master document at the root and add an @Guild task to gather and merge information from other documents scattered about.
  <div></div><div class="" which is a spreadsheet that no one really uses!
  <msg spk="LRRH">We replaced using Dashboard because we have Google Sheet Guild Log.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Then should Master be a Google Doc?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Google Doc viewing options are horrible.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">But it is online, and I don't think we need to view it that often.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But bookmarking is easier on Google Doc.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I oppose to moving data around in general. I think it is okay to share our preferences an experience on how to take notes. But if you start talking about "how we shall standardize note taking for the guild", then it is a waste of time. Just let each person who will use notes choose and take their own notes.
  <msg spk="Zoey">But if you want your notes to help someone else, wouldn't you want to do it in a way that is convenient to others? XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, how much space do we have at clouds?
  <msg spk="StarTree">We used 1 out of 15 GB at Google Drive and 2 out of 5 GB at OneDrive!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">The size of our local guild data is more than 200 GB. You aren't removing any process by moving some of it online.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> I think that is enough exploring today on this topic. I think if the information can benefit others, my preference is to share it here. If for some reason it cannot be shared, then the person with the information decides where to put it. I think in that case it would be helpful enough for them to leave a message here (blogger) on where they put that. Then, the first point of information seeking could be here at blogger, so that we could aim to share information helpful for others.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I agree with that conclusion. I want to see this site becoming more organized and helpful, not just to us but to others.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>Based</b> on the ideas in the previous discussion on note-taking, Sasha presents the Web View Word Day Planner.
  <msg spk="Sasha">It is a word document with a table with daily plans, which includes what we plan to do in future days, and what we did in previous days.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> More about the features in the following.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Reverse Chronological order
  <msg spk="Sasha">This is kept to reduce scrolling. The future is at the top. The idea is to keep it short and keep a pool of tasks to be pulled.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Pull Bin
  <msg spk="Sasha">The pull bin of task can have a due date and a total estimate of task hours.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">By not planning exactly what day they will happen, we don't waste time tweaking a plan that will change.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Dependencies column
  <msg spk="Sasha">This is kept to highlight things we can't control.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Web View Word
  <msg spk="Sasha">This is new, based on Ivy's suggestion. The Web View format allows the view to be resized easily. Excel and OneNote cannot do this.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Without Excel, we don't have the mean to automatically add how many hours are planned for each day. But that math is simple. Just do it in your head.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">And I don't use Outlook for this planner because this word format is easier to edit and share</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Multi Quest
  <msg spk="Sasha">This is new, based on the need to combine the planners of different quest lines.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">The quest title is shown first, followed by its sub quests and hour estimate, ordered by the order they were completed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So within each day, the entries were categorized by quest, and each task is in forward chronological order.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But the overall planner is in reverse order.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think that was pretty much it for now.
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Good work, Sasha.
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's it? Where is the resistance? Where is the drama?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But it is helpful, and if I may I want to add links to places there. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it looks elegant and clear. Elegantly that we are behind schedule. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I don't see the "Bin of tasks".</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">It will be there after adding Fort Arsenal, that 90 day or something estimate.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's aim to use it and continue today, adding Arsenal sub quests.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">We still have Pylon quest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We have about 4 overlapping quests plus guild quest.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Should we add Guild Quests on the same planner?
  <msg spk="Tanya">I would say no, because that would just add overhead. We should show Cardinal Quests only.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">If we did it in spreadsheet we could just filter them out.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">To do that you would need to add a tag on each row to be filtered. That is annoying. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I can think about it, but for now I want to try this and see how well it works, for at least a week or so.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Casey, when we actually do a task, we are still using the Field Log to track the time. We are not losing any history data for analysis.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">What Sasha is doing is a simpler and more summarized version, a big picture version for planning.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">But even in outfield log there is a section for planning future tasks, we just don't use it for some reason.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sylvia">I use it. But for reminders of routine tasks. I think that is convenient for tasks that are recurrent.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I think we can use it more, and tweak that so that it can also be good for Big Picture Planning.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">On that list you already have the list of quests. And if you need to move a task to a different day, you could just change the date. No copy and paste. Then you just sort it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That is compelling. Why did we stop using it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">When I use the field log, I view it in with latest task at the bottom. That future section is completely out of sight. üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree updates those dates in the future section every day!
  <msg spk="StarTree">Sometimes StarTree wonders whether that is necessary...!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I'm not trying to bother anyone, but there is something very similar in function in our field log. It might only do 80% what the additional planner can do, but if we use that, we don't need to manage yet another document that we need to update daily.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Yet another compelling reason.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Sasha hoped for resistance and her @Wish is granted! XD @LRRH</msg>
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I'm not asking people to decide right now, just think about it and maybe try upgrading the field log to do what Sasha's document can do.
  <msg spk="Casey">We know Sasha's document can't replace field log, but the field log could grow toward Sasha's vision of what we need.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I am not posing a competition.</msg>
  <mbaa>Casey receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Red is now reading, and all seems well.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I am all for trying things and making real improvement instead of discussing. I totally agree with Casey's plan. Just do both and copy the strength of each other. I copied the previous way and made small changes, someone can copy mine and make changes. It is all good as long as we are not forcing people to make the changes for them. You make changes by yourself and present it so others can build on your ideas.
  <msg spk="Sasha">If I sounded like I wanted to stop something, I didn't mean to. I was just explaining why I didn't use Excel. I wasn't telling others not to use Excel.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think that is very clear and I do like the simplicity even though I will continue to use field log for what I use it for.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think the day planner has the summary I need for creating weekly report without looking at Field Log. This helps me. Again, Good Job, Sasha.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Since we got several new ideas from the thread, it is a good time to stop discussing so people can just try the ideas instead.
  <msg spk="Sasha">That concludes this briefing, let's move on and try more new ideas.</msg>
  <mbaa>Sasha receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Ooo, my tears. I almost never get Arcacia Award. üòÇ</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Thank you, Sasha.</msg>
  <mbkudo><b>Sasha thanks all plus Arcacia for listening.</b></mbkudo>

  <div class=""><b>Little</b> Red Riding Hood bakes only plain or chocolate chip cookies. She baked two cookies. At least one of them has chocolate chips. She gave me one and gave the other to my dad. What is the probability that my dad got a chocolate chip cookie?
  <msg spk="Casey">Ivy is paraphrasing a puzzle we found today at a thrift store. This is a Puzzle Time kind of post.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <msg spk="Ledia">This sounds super tricky.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>44:</b> 1/3.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Amelia:</b> 1/2.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Tanya:</b> 2/3.</hide>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Could you each explain why?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Amelia:</b> Because knowing that one of them has chocolate chips doesn't tell me anything about the other one.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>44:</b> If we know that at least one has chocolate, then the probability that both have chocolate is one-third.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The question didn't say what cookie Ivy has. So, the equally probably outcomes are: Both Ivy and James have chocolate cookies, Only Ivy has chocolate cookie, or Only James has chocolate cookie. Before you know what Ivy has, James has 2/3 chance of having a chocolate cookie.
  <msg spk="Zoey">But then Ivy also has 2/3 chance of having a chocolate cookie. They don't add up to 1? ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">They don't. That is just like saying if there are 10 buckets of hot water, regardless which one you choose, the chance that it is hot will be 100%. Adding them you get 1000%, but that doesn't mean anything.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">True.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So before Ivy or James reveal what cookie they got, each has 2/3 chance of having a chocolate chip cookie. It doesn't matter if Ivy said "Guess what my dad got first."</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">After one of them has revealed what they got, the chance of the other having a chocolate chip cookie is 50%.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">1/3 chance would be the answer if the question asks, "What is the chance that both have chocolate chip cookies?"</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>44:</b> Then why isn't the probability 75%? 
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b>The possible cookies that Red made are: Choco1, Plain, and Choco2. So the possible outcomes are: <br>
    Ivy-Choco1/James-Plain, <br>
    Ivy-Choco1/James-Choco2, <br>
    Ivy-Choco2/James-Choco1, <br>
    Ivy-Plain/James-Choco1. <br>
    So 75% of the time Ivy would have a chocolate chip cookie.
    </hide>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Just when I thought I understood it! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">...</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> We only know that Choco1 exists 100%. Plain and Choco2 share 50% chance of existing.
  <msg spk="Ledia">So ...</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Choco1 is in all four cases, and each case is paired with something that only has 50% chance of existing.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> I would argue that Ivy-Choco2/James-Choco1 is invalid if you reveal Ivy's cookie first. Whichever cookie you reveal first is called Choco1.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't get it. What if Red can make three cookies: Choco, plain, and mint, but only made 2, at least one is not plain. And we ask what is the odds that Ivy does not have a plain cookie if we know at least one is Choco?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then there would be four possibilities same as what 44 said:<br> Ivy-Choco/James-Plain, <br>Ivy-Choco/James-Mint, <br>Ivy-Plain/James-Choco, <br>Ivy-Mint/James-Choco.<br></msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">The chance that Ivy would get a non-plain cookie is 75%.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">No. Then you are missing the cases: Ivy-Mint/James-Plain and Ivy-Plain/James-Mint. Because you said at least one is non-plain, not at least one is Choco. Assuming you also meant all cookies are unique.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Right. Then together there are 6 cases, and the odds of getting Non-plain is still 2/3.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Do we all agree what the correct answer is?
  <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> Which is 2/3 ?</hide>
  <msg spk="44">Yes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Yes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Thank you for agreeing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Wait, what? Is that the answer or not? XD ü§£</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I can't handle more twists!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Let me explain...
  <msg spk="Casey">When we found this deck of math puzzles at thrift store, naturally Ivy would take a card out and try it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">And when she saw the answer she was MAD.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Because the answer was 1/3.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Just KO me already XD</msg>
  <mbdmg>Zoey is now considered KO'ed.</mbdmg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Ivy insisted that the puzzle answer was wrong or the question was worded wrongly.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">So she wanted confirmation.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">So 2/3 is correct?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That's what it should be, just as Tanya explained.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">And intuitively, if you know nothing about whether one of the cookies must be choco, the chance would be 50%. So why would knowing that one of them must be choco reduce the chance of it being a choco?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">And so Ivy bought the puzzle deck in rage.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <msg spk="James">So, where is my cookie?</msg>
  <mbspell>Red gives everyone a cookie.</mbspell>

  <div class=""><b>For</b> Seed of Peace, I am defining Veganism as a moral view of minimizing harm to sentient beings, which typically translates to having a plant-based diet, opposing animal cruelty and products that made from them.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In terms of peace ranking that would be Coexistence. Veganism poses not to hurt others without a belief of mechanism that sentient beings should help each other.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In case it isn't obvious, this definition means a person who is a vegan CAN use animal product as long as it was not a result of treating animals as commodity.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="" [].
  <msg spk="Tanya">I'd take that so Veganism is based on philosophy on avoid harm, not on a dogma on the ingredient.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">And if you don't know how something was treated, you would normally avoid a commercial product made of them. Since if it is commercialized, the odds are animals are being exploited.</msg>

  <msg spk="Tanya">That's a good idea. Then I will set all the mine locations and Jewel Market to Due 2</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">For everything else I'll put Due 7 for now.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">For anything that requires leyline, let's put Due 14. And everything that needs shipment Due 21.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Done.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Previously, we estimated that each spawn point at Deer Crossing took us 16 hours to seal. Arsenal has 47.
  <msg spk="Tanya">However, the map shows the sub quests, marked by @, we need to do for each spawn point.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then I can make a guess that each @ takes 2 hours and get a possibly closer estimate of remaining load.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That turns out to be 422 hours remaining instead of 752. That is 53 days, so the estimated completion date is 7/14.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Almost a month behind. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It is more than a month behind because that math assumes we do the quest every day. If we only do quests on 5 of 7 days, then...</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It gives August 4.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">I think that is enough estimate for now. Let's put those dates and weights on Sasha's calendar. There are only five dates total and 5 numbers.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Done.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> After some more tweaking, the estimated completion date is 9/19.
  <msg spk="Tanya">There are 9 spawn points that might need crafting materials to seal.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> I think we need to do something about the documentation. Each @ sign there is not worth 2 hours.

  <msg spk="Evelyn">I also used to cough when singing, but in the last few months that has stopped.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> What should happen if a visitor chooses any of them?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Ideally, we provide actual help. If we can't do that, we provide a relevant story.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> When was the last time there was an emergency?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>James:</b> It was January this year. Someone threatened to break in. So we asked Natalie to help.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Now I remembered.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">What did Natalie do?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Normal Paladin procedure would be to contact the person who was alleged to have made the threat that the Paladins are aware of the dispute and hope that the parties can resolve the situation peacefully.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So they didn't send anyone over?</msg>
  <msg spk="James">I didn't ask for it. But if they actually try to break in, it would be an emergency, so I was giving the paladins a heads up.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">And what happened afterwards?</msg>
  <msg spk="James">The person making the threat toned down and situation was resolved peacefully.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Why did the person want to break in? XD
  <msg spk="James">It was a combination of miscommunication, and misuse of technology.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">They were trying to get a room in the guild house, but didn't response when we offered them to come.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">Then they said they sent the money using an online service. When we say we didn't receive it, they didn't believe.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">So they wanted to break in.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Sounded desperate.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">The problem was that that particular online service requires phone registration which was not obvious. It was holding the money without sending it.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">Eventually we did receive the money, but it took a week instead of what we thought would take minutes. And we sent them back the money. As they were to look for another place.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But during the time the service is holding the money, they won't have the fund to pay for another place.</msg>
  <msg spk="James">That was our concern but not theirs. They had enough money to pay for another place. But they were angry even when we showed them the fine prints that the transfer might take two weeks.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Well, what's done is done.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I have no idea that happened. üòñ
  <msg spk="LRRH">Would you like to know the next time something like that happens?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Yes, please.</msg>
  <mbspell>Evelyn is now part of Magic Bakery Emergency Response Team.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I also want to know.</msg>
  <mbspell>Tanya is now part of Magic Bakery Emergency Response Team.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Are they any duty for being on that team XD I'm a Herald, I think I need to be on that team regardless XD.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> There is no duty for being on the team. It just means that if something *worrying* happens, we'll tell you about it.
  <msg spk="Zoey">But do we need to keep that a secret? Can I make a post about it? Then everyone would know.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">If you post inappropriate information we would stop telling you.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't think I have a record of posting anything inappropriate. ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But are you good at keeping secrets?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think I am good at keeping secrets... ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But no one ever tells you their secrets, do they?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't think we have many secrets to begin with. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But if you do have a secret, would you tell Zoey about it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Sasha, I think your questioning is unnecessary. Zoey has a record of keeping secrets because she is part of Cardinal Quest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Compelling argument.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">It's not compelling. If you use that argument, then even <i>I</i> would be trustworthy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD ü§£</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But I'm not asking to be on the team.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I'm just laughing. XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> The emergency response team will decide if someone else needs to know.
  <msg spk="Sasha">See? Being on Cardinal Quest is not enough to establish trust worthiness.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I added Evelyn because she has relevant emergency response skills.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I added Tanya because she has relevant problem solving skills.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I am not adding Zoey yet although she has relevant skill, because I'm not getting the vibe of mental readiness from her.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Red is using ESP! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I'm not complaining. I don't necessarily want to change my 'vibe' just to be on the team.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Red doesn't have ESP. Red has hesitation because Sasha confused her. We will sort it out the next time an emergency happens.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Which, hopefully never happens. üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> From yesterday's study group, how about we end with some affirmative thinking?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> We are not here to deal with emergencies, but to prevent them from happening. We are a great team and we share ideas of preventative tasks.
  <msg spk="Tanya">The next emergency will probably be from Cardinal Quest if we can't seal all the spawn points.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">We are diligent and we seal spawn points ahead of time. We are legendary and celebrated heroes. We are saving the world and having fun doing so. We use all help we can get and that brings us more help than we hope for.</msg>

  <msg spk="Evelyn">Light arrow.</msg>
  <mbdmg>The wraith is destroyed. Evelyn gains 1 EXP.</mbdmg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Sorry, I missed it.</msg>

  <msg spk="Sasha">What task are you doing?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is spell rehearsal. Tanya allocated 2 hours for it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">After that, we should have a better chance completing the sealing confirmation spell. Which is worth another 2 hours.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's sound more like it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">More like what?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">More like she knows what she needs to do.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">According to Tanya's report, I should have done that first so Zoey would take less time down here. üòñ</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Question 1: According to records, a backup generator could use two mana types to tell if the main generator is down. Does our generator use both mana types?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> It does not. It can only use one of them. I don't know what you want to call it.
  <msg spk="Cardinal">How would you like to call it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">It only senses Earth mana. Not air.</msg>
  <mbspell>Casey earns 1 EXP.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That means we might need to run an Earth mana leyline to the chamber above.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Why didn't you get the one that can use air mana?</msg>

  <msg spk="Tanya">Ignorance.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But we won't be if we start digging and answering the questions.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Question 2: Does the main generator above have room for another Earth mana leyline?

  <msg spk="Tanya">That answer is not good enough.</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">We can check when the chamber above is open next week.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That's a better answer.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">If we connect them, we are actually doing more than the other teams are doing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That's like asking, do we dare to do better than the other team...</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">That's not what I meant. I'm just saying we are doing something extra.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I... had a dream last night.</msg>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> In my dream, what effort we put into Arsenal is not extra. It is preventative.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Wait, have you started using ESP already? XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I tried... üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I agree with Evelyn regardless whether there is ESP involved. Fort Arsenal is an important location and we are talking about the barrier. This seems like a low hang fruit even if you believe it is an upgrade.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If you act with love you would include those upgrades.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If we have the experience that it is a good design, we would recommend it to the other teams. We just lack the experience to make the recommendation now. We need to first prove that it works and is better.</msg>
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Casey">You're right. That's the Arcacian way.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sylvia:</b> There should be room for the leyline because HK will need to expand it for the market.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Good call. Then we should confirm that the main crystal can accept the backup generator spell before getting and installing the leyline.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I added that task to the planner.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Thank you.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> How sure are we that it will work? Should I start looking for suitable materials?
  <msg spk="Tanya">But if it doesn't work, we are wasting time looking now.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">My experience is that adding to the material list is almost always a time saver.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Anyway I added. ü§∑</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Then can we also start the check list? We should define the criteria to determine whether the spawn point is sealed.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Agreed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I added a task on the planner to look for the checklist of the other team.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think we should add something... I feel that it might not exist. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Of course you may add more checks.</msg>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [6:52 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> So... How do we test the backup barrier generator? Do we actually shut down the main generator? üòÖ
  <msg spk="Tanya">We should do some preliminary tests before the big test.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">So I've added to the checklist. Is that task considered complete?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I would say yes. If we need to update it, we would need to update it 'for free'.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Okay.</msg>
  <mbspell>Remaining hours is now 333.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Creating the checklist seems an easy way to reduce the hours.</msg>
  <mbspell>Tanya updated the list. The remaining hours is now 340.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Tanya">There was an spawn point that had not estimation. I've just added it. Please don't be discouraged.</msg>

  <msg spk="Tanya">That was the only one.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">We are heroes and full of positivity. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then I'll solo the Howling Circle checklist. That seems super easy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">It is not called a checklist. It is called a rehearsal, or mock battle.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Simulated battle.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I like that. I am soloing it.</msg>
  <mbspell>Ledia soloed the mock fight and earned 1 EXP.</mbspell>

  <msg spk="Evelyn">But there is no reason not to try it if it could help someone. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That's true, but I don't understand the meditation part. I can't get to the alpha state.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I thought being in alpha state just means you are relaxed and positive.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Is that all? Then why does it ask for meditation? XD</msg>

  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't know for sure. üòÖ</msg>

  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> It is like using the pedal when you play the piano. When I sing and I don't feel it, I could just "step on the pedal" and create the aura and sustain it throughout the singing.
  <msg spk="P4">Yes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then it isn't really an award if you could give it to yourself. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't think Arcacianism is against people rewarding themselves. You are supposed to let your better self manifest and reward yourself. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That's three free points everyday. ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">That's three free points for everyone who chooses to connect to the better self each day. Many of us don't do that. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That makes me feel that everyone in the guild should get at least 3 points if they just show up.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think that is a good aim, but no pressure. üòä</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> But if all you need is to flip on the switch and cast the spell, isn't that too easy? There is no cost. ü§î
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Why would you want there to be a cost? üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> What is alpha state?
  <msg spk="Zoey">It is a brain wave frequency of about 8 to 13 Hz. When people are awake they are normally in the beta state which is 14 to 30 Hz.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Umm... correction: Beta State corresponds to being <i>Actively</i> awake. Meaning that you are awake and attending to a task.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">You are in Alpha state when you are in 
  <msg spk="Ivy">Inattention and daydream while awake are in Alpha state. If you zone out from your sensory perceptions while awake, you are in alpha.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then why the emphasis on meditation? I can zone out anytime I want XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Maybe we don't. üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I am not entirely convinced when you switch on the Arcacian Aura you are in alpha state. We know the Arcacian Aura can happen while people are attentively doing something.
  <msg spk="Ivy">It might be a separate phenomenon. So I won't say they are the same until I measure it with EEG.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That I can understand.</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">Shouldn't 15 hours be more like 3 days instead of just 1? XD</msg>

  <msg spk="Ledia">I think all we should really care is whether we at least finish about 6 hours per day. The clock will keep ticking and "undo" our work. It is too stressful to keep looking at it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. So this is a situation where the Heroes shouldn't be told how many hours they need to complete to reduce the date at the end of the day.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Even if they put extra effort to complete it, it would immediately expire since they had only barely reached a moving target.</msg>

  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I want a walk through style comments on what we read. We post the material and the alleged effects, then we add our comments, fact checks and experience along the way. Similar to the style of chapter 11.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Yes that is what I think we should do. But I don't know how to do it without copying everything we read. So it would take time paraphrasing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Unless we find a copy free version.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">As for adding them to Chapter 20, I am still upgrading the presentation format.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think this is a backburner topic. Just ignore it until you have time for it, and concentrate on finishing what you have now.
  <msg spk="Sasha">If it is still relevant by the time you are done with what you are doing, then you will remember to do it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think it is better to just start with a place where we could put what we learned and build on it.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I assume our study group is on-going. After reading this, where would be more we are reading.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't think we would have time going through each thing we read and turn them into a tutorial like Chapter 11.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But we should be able to pick and add the best concept we learned to Chapter 20.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Ok. Let's add both to Chapter 20 as Cleric skills.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <mbrec>Evelyn is recognized for the Cleric skill Affirmation.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Legit.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think visualization is the same as affirmation, but done without using words.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> "Visualization is an technique to perform Affirmation using mental images instead of (or in conjunction with) verbal descriptions. To use this technique, one would rehearse or visualize themself performing in the role they affirm themselves to be, associated with the joy, pride, and sense of accomplishment to help direct one's subconscious mind toward such desirable future. To help the subconscious mind remember and accept the goal, it is said visualization (and also affirmation) is more effective when performed in relaxed state of mind when brainwave is at alpha or theta levels."
  <mbrec>Evelyn is recognized for the Cleric skill Visualization.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That's a good summary of what we read without any controversial topics</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Just a quick comment or suggestion. I think it is better if good skills are part of the routine.
  <msg spk="Black">Then you can be sure that you will practice it daily without forgetting.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> In the early hours before you get up, your mind would be in theta state even if you aren't trying to meditate.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">So if we want to fit it in the routine, it would be before Paladin Training.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">@StarTree, please add to the routine.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">What should that session be called?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">How about Positivity Time?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">It is added!</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Is it true that if I visualize myself doing Paladin Training, I don't have to actually go? XD</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't think theta state is that exciting. We would be barely conscious. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I am fine with Affirmation Time. We won't be gathering for that. We just do it around the time we wake up and that could be different for everyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">True. ü§î</msg>

  <msg spk="Ledia">The battle version?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree can't give Ledia a report she didn't ask for!</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Then give ME the battle version.</msg>
  <mbdmg>Fort Arsenal barrier power will run out by June 28. The region will come under heavy attack with uncountable losses for at least one month as the heroes scramble to seal the spawn points in prolonged exhaustion.</mbdmg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Hmm... If we need to complete by June 28, we actually need to complete about 12 quest hours each day?
  <msg spk="Vivi">At last someone can do simple math.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then I better do at least one hour. It only takes 12 people one quest hour each.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Mwahahaha you're so naive! That's not going to happen!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That's not something that I would worry about.</msg>
  <hr class="">  
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> @StarTree, Guidance. What are the easiest quest hours to complete?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Tanya categorically marked all of the quests in the mines with a question mark, which represents 4 quests hours. But according to earlier report, some of them are simple and should not get those question marks!
  <msg spk="Ledia">Could you give an example?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Jade mine shaft 8, level 2, chamber 7. Jade mine shaft 9, level 4, chamber 8. Sapphire mine shaft 6, level 2, chamber 2. These spawn points only have low level monsters well-described in the monster manual. They should be easily sealed!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I go to each of the location to do their trial.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Ledia, you easily completed the trials at two spawn points, but had problem completing at chamber 7. What monster do you want there to have?
  <msg spk="Ledia">Let's say they are all jellies but the ones at chamber 7 have natural camouflage. Even if I take out the ones I can see, the trial still fails. because I can't hit what I can't see and they are not aggressive and don't give much threat for my paladin sense to detect.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I'm enjoying this. This is a proper Cardinal Quest! üòÜ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I almost want to say let's ignore that spawn point but I am going to ask my fellow paladins for advice.</msg>
  <mbspell>Ledia starts writing a letter to Arx HQ.</mbspell>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> You're going to ask your Headquarters about jellies? Level 1 monsters? They're going to laugh at you!
  <msg spk="Ledia">At least that'll be entertaining.</msg>
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> With her effort, Ledia had reduced the quest hours by 14 hours.
  <mbmerit>Ledia had reduced the quest hours to 290.</mbmerit>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Congratulations, Ledia! You've finished enough hours for the party today by yourself!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> But your luck is going to run out. These are the easiest spawn points. It is only going to get harder.
  <msg spk="Ledia">But while reading the report StarTree gave me, I found a clue about a chamber nearby.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Clues are useless. You still don't know what it takes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But now I know what to ask for.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Are you going to bombard your HQ with questions?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I'll start looking for a hero who knows better and recruit them to help, and collect clues in the meantime.</msg>
  <mbmerit>Ledia had reduced the quest hours to 286.</mbmerit>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> As a result, Ledia knocked out 18 quest hours and reduced the completion date to July 20. Is this the most the heroes can complete in a single day? Can the heroes prevent the incoming calamity? Stay tuned for the next episode of Cardinal Quest!

  <msg spk="Zoey">Does that actually work? This sounds more like a movie plot. ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I guess that is possible if the robber or someone he knows can use it. üòÖ</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> May I ask a moral alignment question?
  <msg spk="Sasha">If a blood bank is reserving donated blood for rich people, is it okay for poor people to steal the blood to help poor people?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">You could simplify that question to "if you have a rare blood type that could help save someone else life, do you have a right to refuse donating blood?"</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That turns into an @Concept question XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Mikela">The channel is open for free discussion!</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">That situation is answered in Stewardism reciprocation. If you can help someone but you choose not to, it creates a right for others to not help you. So if you are not willing to donate something that is regenerative (such as your blood), then it is not wrong for other to help you with what is regenerative for them, or to help you with something that is more permanent.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So if someone tries to restrain me and steal my blood, you would just stand there an do nothing if I refused to donate in the first place? Isn't that against my autonomy?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If your refusal to donate blood would result in someone else losing their life, then your disregard of their autonomy permits your autonomy to be disregarded.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">In that situation, defending you would violate reciprocation. I could choose to be neutral and do nothing. But everyone has a right to restrain you to take your blood because you refused.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But you are not giving me a choice if you are allowed to take it by force.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">That is reciprocation to your not giving others a choice when you could afford to offer such choice. If they are asking for something that will kill you or leave you disabled, than that's different.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But they are taking my time, and time is life. So they are taking my life.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If that if your argument that people could just do it while you are sleeping. It is fine if you ask for compensations and accomodations. But a flat "NO" is gross disregard of autonomy. If you just care about your autonomy but not that of others, you can't ask for others to respect your autonomy either.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Compelling reasoning.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Isn't Stewardism supposed to be neutral? If you help someone take by blood, that is not neutral. You picked a side.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Stewardism doesn't say I have to help anyone or I have to stay out of the way. It is within my choice to help or not. But due to reciprocation, stopping others from taking your blood violates Stewardism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I can see that it violates reciprocation, but I don't agree with your definition of autonomy. I think autonomy should include the choice to not help other people. So if I choose not to help others, they could choose not to help me. But they can't be allowed take things from me.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Stewardism is a moral code, not a law code. It is just saying that you can't demand others to respect your autonomy if you don't respect other's.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I know but you are not listening to what I said. Taking is different from not giving. If I don't give, others don't need to feel bad not giving to me. But as long as I don't take, others have no rights to take from me.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Your word "respect" doesn't distinguish between taking and giving.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Stewardism doesn't distinguish them because a person is allowed to actively get what they need. Disrespecting someone's autonomy means treating them as objects or not caring whether they may continue to be alive. So if you treat others as objects, they can treat you as an object.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But I am not doing anything to them. Say they are half way across the globe and I just happen to have the blood type. I didn't go half way across to stop them to get blood or find a solution. What gives them the right to come half way to take my blood against my will. My refusal didn't disrespect anyone's autonomy. Their coming to take my blood is the disrespect of autonomy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Your refusal to help someone stay alive when you could is the initial disrespect of autonomy. Their coming is a reaction to your disregard. Say you receive a letter request your blood to save someone's life. What is your reply? So far your reply is just "I don't want to and I don't care if they die."</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But if autonomy is a right, then that should be what it means and what I am allowed to reply without retaliations.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">We are disagreeing on whether not helping someone in need is a disregard of autonomy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Fina, do you agree that not helping someone needing autonomy assistance is disregard of autonomy, but not a violation of their autonomy? Disregard and violation seem to have different meaning.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Sasha is saying that disregard can be reciprocated with disregard, but it takes a violation to be reciprocated with violation.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Right! If am apathetic, then others can be apathetic to me. But only if I go out of my way to attack someone, others should not be allowed to attack me.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If you are apathetic about someone dying, that means that others are allowed to be apathetic about you dying. That means others are allowed to let people treat you as an object. Then you are a piece of public resource, like a piece of regenerative forest land. People can come harvest and let you regenerate. Because someone would die from your apathy, disregard and violation would lead to the same outcome of your being classified as a resource.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But the result is I didn't enslave anyone, but I get enslaved. How is that equivalent reciprocation?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">I didn't say enslave. I said people can come and take your blood and supply you with what you need to regenerate. They can do that while you are unconscious. They are not asking you to do anything for them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But if I don't naturally sleep, or if I live in a very secured house, would you let people break my house and put me into sleep? You already said they have a right to restrain me. So even if that doesn't qualify as slavery, that still qualifies as imprisonment.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So if I didn't poke a needle into someone, you are letting others force a needle into me. You are saying that I'm not a human being unless I help other human beings even when I never attacked them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If you treat someone as non-human, you don't need to attack them to be treated as non-human. In Stewardism, the default is that all objects are to be taken cared of. If you treat someone without care of them as a human being, why do you demand others to treat you with the care as a human being?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But you didn't answer my question. Are you going to break into my house and put me to sleep?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Qualified damages should be restored. But normally if you put a fence around a public apple tree to prevent others from accessing the tree, then breaking the fence is not damage that needs to be restored. So if you try to keep people away after disregarding them as human beings, all of your defenses can be taken down. No one has responsibility to restore them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">How is that not terrorism?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">It is going for your blood, not to kill you or prevent you from doing what you want otherwise.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But how often do you need to do that? If you need to do that once a week, them I'm basically in a prison without walls. The result is still either I take my own time to give you my blood once a week, or you would come and take my blood once a week. There is no choice.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">That is compared to your not giving the other the choice to live. You denied other's the choice to live when you have the power to let live. The reciprocation spares your life. You are already at a bargain.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But I didn't put them in their condition to begin with, so why do I need to do anything?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If they are at fault for their condition, then that's true you don't need to do anything. Otherwise there is no excuse. It is like saying if someone is hanging on a balcony and you consciously choose not to help when you could do something safely to save them, then while you are still in a position to help, others may do what it takes to override disregard to save someone. You don't have a right to keep others from breaking into your house to get to the balcony to save the dangling person.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Hospitalian Knights should agree.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That's correct. In that situation, damages to the house are considered self-inflicted by the party making the path to assist inaccessible.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But we are not talking about balconies, but blood. Blood is inside my body.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">But we are not talking about someone needing help on their homework, but needing help to stay alive. If a vampire wants your blood just to know its taste, that won't warrant anyone helping the vampire get your blood.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But what if the vampire needs blood as staple food source? Then everyone needs to volunteer their blood or be bitten?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then it is a matter of sustainability. You can defend against an unsustainable life style and just say no.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then why can't I refuse to give blood?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If it is one-time deal then it is not unsustainable. In reciprocation there is a consideration of effort. If the blood taken from you takes 1 year to restore, then everyone trying to take your blood is signing themselves up to take care of you for 1 year.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Suddenly it sounds fair. Let me think about it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">That is within what you could ask for as fair compensation in Stewardism. Stewardism doesn't ask you to help people for free. Helpers need to be reimbursed to maintain sustainability.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Sasha is grinning at her imagination of having a servant for a year.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Sasha totally spaced out. Even though "1 year to recover from donating blood" was totally hypothetical! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">It is not really hypothetical. Even if it takes only 3 days to recover, if you do it every 3 days, then you are perpetually cared for. That is, if there is a demand of it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That's true. ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Many people are willing to donate blood for free, so... let's return to reality? üòÖ</msg>

        <hr class=" mbhr"=""><b>I</b> am planning to go through each </a> as a training module in the theme of a dungeon crawl. 
  <msg spk="Tanya">In each module, there will be a short description of the zombie, followed by a few statements. Some of the statements would match the zombie type. The player is trying to spot the zombie of the same time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">When they click on a choice, the choice would immediately tell them whether they are right or wrong.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If we are fancy then we will add a hitpoint bar. Otherwise it is just click and reveal answer.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I need help presenting/formatting it, and also interesting statements for the real zombies and the decoys.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I'm in. This sounds fun.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I am just going to go through each fallacy one by one. But you could skip ahead if there is one you want to do.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> The first one is Strawman zombie. The short description is Strawman zombies attack using a voodoo doll. When the zombie pokes the doll with a needle, susceptible heroes would think that they were hurt and become manipulated by the zombie to attack other healthy heroes.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think that sounds a bit wordy but we could work on that.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Then we need at least two examples. An example would feature either a statement or a short dialogue, followed by two choices: Strawman zombie spotted, or Strawman zombie clear. Spotted and Clear for short.
  <msg spk="Tanya">What should those examples be?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> How about: A says, "Zombies live in the catacomb, they have a right to defend against intruders." and B says, "If you let them call anywhere home, then there won't be space for living people."
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Just to be clear, that was a positive example, correct?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct. B was using a strawman argument.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> I have a suggestion. Why don't you start with the player choosing a statement they believe in, then see what a strawman reply would be from someone opposing it?
  <msg spk="Tanya">And what statement would you like to start with?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">"I believe that each person has a right to do nothing even if they know that their inaction would result in someone's death."</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Isn't that opposite of what you said this morning?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">For the sake of the training dungeon, the dungeon can show both paths: "I believe that people don't have a right to do nothing when they know that their inaction would result in someone's death."</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">For either statement, there is a way to reply with a strawman, and a way to reply without.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Are we trying to train ourselves to not use Strawman, or are we trying to train ourselves on what to do if someone else uses Strawman against us?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Both.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Okay. It seems complicated. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If we do both sides of a statement, and do both speaking and replying, there are four scenarios, and each scenario needs a strawman choice and a non-strawman choice. That's eight.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I kind of like Ledia's example talking about zombie rights. It is funnier.
  <msg spk="Ledia">But I can see how Fina's idea would be immediately useful.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If you do both then that is 16 choices XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I mainly want to learn how to response when someone uses strawman against someone or myself.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> How about we go back to Ledia's dialogue for a second and list what we think would be effective ways to respond?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think my choice would be, instead of saying "That's not what I meant", provide the law that zombies follow on defining their home.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">For example, I could say the zombies were placed there, so they have a a right to call the catacomb their home against the people who placed them there.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think in Tanya's scenario, the zombies were summoned. They were not re-animated from corpses that were placed there. The zombies were intruders infesting burial ground of heroes. Most of them have no idea why they were there. They were spawned there.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I'll let Ledia fill in the gap about the context, since Ledia worked there before.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Okay. üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then in that context, the zombies are living in the catacomb because they were placed there. But they don't have the right to live there, do they? So A was wrong, correct?
  <msg spk="Ledia">We don't have to agree on whether A was right or not.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But if we don't fix one stance for the discussion it would be really confusing ü§£ XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Could we have a show of hand on whether the forcefully summoned zombies have a right to live there? Those in favor:
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> ‚úîÔ∏èüòñ</hide>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Those oppose:</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> ‚ùå</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> ‚ùå</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Fina:</b> ‚ùå</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> ‚ùå</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> ‚ùå</hide>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Because there is no consensus, let's continue without assuming whether zombies have the right to live there. The reader can decide whether A expresses their belief. The training will focus on whether the response to A is a strawman.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then we are down to two choices. üëç</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">May be three. So two more. We need a reply to A that is not a strawman, and a good reply on B's strawman from A. Then the situation is covered.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">üëç</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Anyone has a situation for either?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I have a non strawman alternative to B's reply: "In the scenario, the summoned zombies are from a different space, not from the heroes that the catacomb was built for. Do you believe that both the heroes and the summoned zombies have a right to live there?"</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Am I supposed to answer that? üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Not for the training module. Please wait. Now a reply to B's strawman.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Because they were summoned there against their will, they have a right to be where they are. I don't believe that people have a right to attack them just because they are not where the living people want them to be.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think I spotted a strawman. Ledia didn't talk about attacking zombies.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Sorry, I thought that was implied. üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Hold on, we said Ledia's reply was a strawman because A never said they would just let the zombies roam. But Evelyn's reply was she would let zombies roam, and they could call wherever they are home. Wouldn't that mean Ledia did not make a Strawman? She hit the actual argument.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Not at the time the statement was made. When Ledia made that statement, she didn't know that Evelyn would confirm that belief.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Objection. If Ledia knows that is a strawman because in this exercise she intentionally assumed that A didn't mean that and tried to make it seem ridiculous. But in an actual debate, the person making the strawman could believe that that's what A meant. And in this case, that guess was correct. Then B did not try to misrepresent A's position. B correctly represented A's position.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> A can judge whether B's reply is a strawman. Because Ledia created the dialogue, Ledia knew what A was thinking instead. Presumably, A's position was different from Evelyn's, therefore in her scenario, A would have said B's reply was a misrepresentation.
  <msg spk="Zoey">OMG We need to know what A actually thought! We've got adds! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I'll deal with the adds.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> A's position was that the subterranean domain (where sun light can't normally reach) is traditionally the domain of the undead. The catacomb is underground. The living people have no rights to section the undead domain real estates. It is for the undead to decide.
  <msg spk="Ledia">A didn't believe that the undead can just roam anywhere, especially not above ground where the living people lives. But underground, they have a right.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Therefore B's reply was a strawman.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> I am not trying to make another branch for the discussion, but Stewardism doesn't arbitrary assign the living to take the aboveground and the undead to take the underground. Whether something has a right to live depends on whether they give equivalent right for others to live. If they don't try to accommodate, you don't have to try to accommodate. Zombies don't respect anything's right. They just spread. They don't have rights by reciprocation.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I am not saying that you won't, but I believe they should be treated with respect because they cannot control what they are doing. I think they should be horded back to a place where they can't hurt anyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Evelyn, good job demonstrating how to express your belief without spawning strawman. By saying, "I am not saying that you won't."</msg>
  <mbrec>Evelyn is recognized for having a staff of sanctuary.</mbrec>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> But I am visualizing a party going to the catacomb, got the only light magic party member and that party member happens to be a conscientious objector of using light magic against the undead.
  <msg spk="Sasha">üòÑ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I can use light magic too.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It depends on the purpose of the mission. I still have Protect and Sleep. We could just sneak by unharmed even if they try to attack us. We don't need to fight them. üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Zombies at the catacomb are cursed beings. Their souls are not at peace, but in a constant state of torment. You can release them from the curse by either destroying their physical body, or use de-curse type spells to release their souls.
  <msg spk="Ledia">I assume that you don't know de-curse spells. But even if you do, Clerics that go to the catacomb eventually accept that the physical way is easier, quicker, and safer than casting de-curse. To cast de-curse you would generate a wild area aura, you will get mad aggros.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So just beat them up. It might not look nice, but it is safer and more humane because it is quicker.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I am imagining a situation where someone is locked in a burning building. Do you take the time to pick the lock, or do you just kick down the door?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Exactly.</msg>
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Ledia">It is also safer for the caster because de-cursing means the caster need to connect to the soul of the cursed. Normal casters can't handle the torment happening in the zombie's mind. They will get PTSD from trying.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it is better if we can skip traumatic suggestions.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">We'll fight happy zombies then XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I'm following a rule adopted earlier that the stories and themes we use cannot contain any trauma we create just for the explanation or entertainment. If we add any traumatic element to a story, it can only reflect existing traumatic event in real life that we are trying to resolve.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Otherwise, for story purposes, the representation and description should stop at the abstraction that "Zombies have hit points" and Heroes have attacks and other skills that can decrease their hit points.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">You may imagine what the scene is in your head. But you may only post abstractions at Magic Bakery because Magic Bakery is supposed to be an E-rated blog.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">No contest. That is why we call Arx Catacomb the Arxade. When you hit a zombie, stars come out. Enough stars come out then things are good.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Ledia, I think your description is sufficient.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I imagine when I cast an attack spell they turn into gold coins and treasure chests.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Just the usual XD ü§£</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> May I learn surgical de-curse? A skill that allow me to release cursed soul link telepathically, that is safe and with a low aura signature? üòñ
  <msg spk="Zoey">That sounds so high level XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">@Cardinal.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> How about a skill that let you enchant objects so that on contact, there is a chance to release zombie curse?
  <msg spk="Sasha">How is that different from just shooting them with a light spell?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">I am offering a skill that can enchant fighter weapons so that all of them have a chance to instant KO a zombie they hit.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then what if she enchants the ground?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">The larger object she enchants, the more mana it takes and increases the signature. If she wants to have a low aura signature, then enchant just pin points.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So, just the tip of a sword instead of the whole blade. Except it wouldn't really matter whether my sword is enchanted if it hits, since zombies have low hit points...</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">But if she enchants the ground, and zombies aggro the ground, and they get released on contact, then there is no fighting.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">The enchanted object is mana-linked to the spell caster. Every time it releases a curse, the caster's mana is deducted. The caster is KO'ed on mana-overdraw. And, if the zombie is not released on contact, the zombie follows the mana-link toward the spell caster.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I would take that skill.</msg>
  <mbrec>Evelyn is gains the Cleric enchantment skill Soul Release Rank B.</mbrec>

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>For</b> Honorism, I'm defining it as a moral view that promotes and celebrates people who are honorable without implying that honor can be exchanged for any tangible reward.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Honor Society recognizes honorable people and honorable deeds, but does not necessary connect those recognitions to rewards and priorities.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">This is for @Seed, to be posted at Seed of Peace. Any objection or addition?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Honorism appeals to those who believe that people should do good for goodness sake, not for the reward. Arcacianism is compatible with Honorism because in Arcacianism if you use your credits (honor) to bid on things for priority, you lose those credits.
  <msg spk="Tanya">The concept that honor is quantifiable is missing in Honorism. Honorism is mainly qualitative and spiritual instead of "functional".</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">In Arcacian Society, people who subscribes to Honorism are those who typically don't care about their numerical ranking and don't use their credits to bid for any priority. They keep 100% of their credits they have ever earned because earning credits to spend is not their intention. They earn credits for the sake of doing good or the sake of being recognized as honorable. Not for the sake of spending them.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> Then I have a question: If two sick people seek your help, but one is willing to let go of some honor credits to be prioritized. Is it honorable to prioritize helping the one that let go of credits, or to treat them equally and decide randomly?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In Arcacian Society the answer is clear. The priority goes to the one willing to spend credits. The moral reason is that those people got their honor from helping others. They have a right to be prioritized, at the cost of their earned credits. Arcacian moral holds that as a fair arrangement and compensation.
  <msg spk="Tanya">On the other hand, "Honorism" is not well-defined. It is up to you to define which is more honorable in your style of honorism.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Then if someone defines treating others equally is honorable, then Arcacianism is dishonorable.
  <msg spk="Tanya">On the other hand, Arcacianism would NOT say that deciding randomly is dishonorable. As a healer, if you choose not to prioritize helping those willing to shred their credits, then you are not arcacian. You are still earning credits for helping. You are still honorable.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So if you choose to define Arcacianism to be not honorable, Arcacianism would not contest your definition. It is compatible to the kind of Honorism that do not have contradicting definition.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Fair enough.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then I also have a question: In Arcacianism, you get credits for helping people. Do you get more credits if you prioritize and help someone who won a credit bid?
  <msg spk="Tanya">I need to think about it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I would think that it does. You get Extra Credits for helping, and you get Extra Credits for promoting Arcacian values.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">In reciprocation that would make sense. If you honor someone spending credits to get priority, then you should earn honor for doing so.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Does a provider who distributes help in Arcacian priority earn extra credits for adopting that priority?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I don't recall having such credits. If you are Arcacian, you prioritize but you get the same credits you would if you just help randomly, or whoever you want to help. If you can only help one person, you get the same amount of credits regardless which one you help.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think that result comes from Aracianism being a philosophy based on an Alchemist world view.
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Prioritizing is a matter of last resort. Alchemist world view is a world view of abundance, and strides to help everyone. If you give people extra credits for prioritizing , you could end up promoting scarcity.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> So the scoring doesn't allocate any credits for prioritizing. After helping the first person, whoever helps the second person gets the next credit. The focus is on helping the second person also, and the rest of them.
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Arcacia has spoken XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">But isn't it a little odd that you get credits for helping people, but not for being Arcacian?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That just means that Arcacia doesn't give credits for being loyal.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> In Stewardism, not taking care of care takers first is considered unsustainable. It is not morally neutral. It is a moral violation.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> There is no contradiction because if the target is trying to help someone, reimbursement is implied. The Arcacian Reward is not reimbursement. It is something extra beyond simply resupplying the helpers with what they need to keep helping.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">That is in Step 4 at @Carrot. Reimbursement and Reward are different. The reward is in addition to sustainability.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> That section also states that when you give others a reward, you earn Extra Credits, and that creates a network of people wanting to reward good deeds.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">To me that means you do get credits for giving rewards. Giving reward implies prioritization.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">But Tanya is also right that the focus is not to prioritize but to help everyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">So when two people are in need, you get more total credits by prioritizing the one spending credits, and also help the second. If you help the one without credit first before rewarding the one with credits, you would end up getting fewer credits even if you help both.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Step 5 made it clear the intention that this mechanism needs to be practiced routinely to prepare for calamities. There is credit for following the priority. Not following the priority still gives credits, just not as much.</msg>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I can see situations where if the credits for following the priority is not too much, the overall accounting would still promote helping everyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">So Fina and I were right. We do get Extra Credits for prioritizing XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Sorry, I was wrong.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">But you were pointing out something important that Arcacia would agree. üòä</msg>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">The whole point is to help everyone, but in order to minimize conflict, there is a priority for people to be familiar with.</msg>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> The priority is that the priority is secondary. XD
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <mbrec>Zoey is recognized for Magician Skill Confusionism.</mbrec>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> I nominate Evelyn as an Arcacian Ambassador.

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>This</b> week we adopted abbreviation to replace the alphanumeric code we used for field logging.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Previously, Tanya introduced the enumeration code of a letter followed by two digits. B was for Boss fights, and S was for spawn points.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But as time went on, no one could remember the code. Looking it up was annoying and took time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So we changed the code for field logging to a mostly two letter abbreviation. For example, Twinkle Light Tavern is abbreviated to LT instead of I-don't-remember-what-it-was.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Yes I think it is easier with abbreviations.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I was more concerned that we would miscount and miss a spawn point. So they were numbered sequentially. And that was before we gave a name to each of them.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> And there is another purely numeric code that we need to assgin in the registry. The alphanumic code has a direct translation to that code.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> But in practice, virtually no one needs to know that numeric code. For logging we need to location code, that we use every day many times.
  <msg spk="Zoey">As far as I understand, the numeric code in the registry has no significance other than listing the spawn points in an order. I think we shouldn't even record them anywhere else, so that if someone decides to arrange the order at the registry, they could just do that and nothing else needs to be changed.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. Although I have already started another numeric convention for the registry. Code 1000s are for spawn points that need crafting materials to seal. Code 2000s are for those that only require magic spells. Code 3000s are those that required neither, or only procedures and instructions.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I did that so when we list them on our field map, they can be listed in the approximate order of when their sub quests should be completed. You won't need to individually filter which spawn points have material gathering subquests.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That does sound convenient, but if someone tries to change the order at the registry, they would have to change the code on our field map.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think we almost never change the registry code.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">An alternative is to just ad a sorting code on the field map that is unrelated to the registry code. Then you can sort the field map all you want, and other people can change the registry order all they want.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I'll consider it. But it is a little unsettling when there is no unique code specifying which field map item corresponds to which registry item.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think it is not too hard to tell from the text title. And in the field map, we have scroll codes, those are unique and we can't change those. That is the cross-checking you could use to avoid errors.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I do like the 1000s 2000s 3000s numbering convention. I think it will look more organized.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> And so the team will probably make further tweaks looking for ways that are easy to remember, easy to sort, and easy to change. Will the team find another breakthrough? We shall see when that happens!
  <mbkudo><b>Sasha thanks the team for sharing experience on making it easier. </b></mbkudo>

  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I didn't finish Serpent Cave, it still has 12 hours remaining XD
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> What is left for Serpent Cave that we can complete today? I prefer to do a subquest where we could complete within today and reduce the quest hours.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I can't promise we can knock off any quest hour, but I am about to physically scout the Serpent Caves. I got clues about where magic circles were set in another area. Now I need to scout and look for those place in our caves.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> If we succeed, how many hours can we complete?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Finding where to set the magic circles is worth 2 hours. Complete the magic circles is another 4 hours.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Is it important for the magic circles to be set at equivalent locations? I thought they can be set anywhere within the aura of the area crystal.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey shares the six old locations she found earlier.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think the first two are fixed. The last two are arbitrary. I am not sure about the middle two.

  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Zoey, could you get the raw form of the sister crystal so we can compare?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Yes but no. I maxed out on my elemental trace skill, if I keep doing it, no one else can level up XD
  <msg spk="Tanya">Our priority should be efficiency.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> How about you show us once, then we know how to do it?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> It is not that hard. Here it goes XD
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Zoey skillfully identitied the raw crystal, and discovered a guardian crystal of the sister crystal that might also have important clues.
  <msg spk="Ledia">That was a pretty complicated process.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It is pretty easy conceptually XD but there are also some details here and there...</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Zoey, you are Rank S at this skill. You internalized many details and do it as second nature. It is not easy for someone who hasn't done it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">It is <i>Alien</i>, to be honest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I guess not... But if I am the only one doing it, they we aren't really trying to solo anything are we?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">A subquest being soloable doesn't mean it is efficient for anyone to randomly solo any quest. It is more efficient if each person solo the part they are good at then hand the next part to someone else. But in case no one is available, the subquest is still soloable if the quester takes the time to learn what is going on. That would just take longer.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I kind of understand what you mean, but somehow it is not satisfying.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We have different strengths, we could all solo the part we are good at. We don't need to team up. That was the conclusion from the "Buddy System" post.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Which you can find at Magic Detective.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">But that is somehow not satisfying.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I came because I am familiar with this part. I am going to show the differences so we can mark the changes we need for our magic circles.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Marking is not difficult. Judging might be more involved. Illuminate Crystal.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Tanya illuminated the crystals, projecting 241 differences surrounding the party.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Are we marking all of them or only the ones related the Serpent?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I suggest marking all of them in the first round, then check what are relevant in the second round.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Tanya, Zoey, and Evelyn started marking the difference.
  <msg spk="Ledia">I will join. Since nothing else is going on...</msg>
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Ledia and P4 join marking the difference.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It will sure go faster if we all do it together. üòä</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I don't understand. Aren't you trying to find just two locations? Why do you need to mark everything? I bring up the parts of the scroll related to the locations in question.
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> What does Sasha conclude?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I see nothing suggesting that they aren't arbitrary. I add them to the location list to clear those two quest hours.
  <mbcomplete>Remaining Quest Hours is reduced to 234.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Um... do we stop?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> No. Please continue marking all of them. We are doing this to prevent mistakes when we transplant relevant changes to our crystal.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Sasha, is what we are doing necessary? Got any <i>Clever</i> shortcuts?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I don't know if it is necessary, but when we judge whether a change is relevant, we need to put our conclusion somewhere. The way they are marked now makes it easier to put those comments.
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Sasha joins the team effort.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Might as well.
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Casey joins the team effort.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòä</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I know it is almost over, but I have an efficiency idea: If you see a cluster of changes that are close together, you could just mark the whole cluster together. Because chances are they serve related function, so if we don't need them, we don't need the whole group.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> It might be okay for this comparison, but please avoid doing that in general.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Why not?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> When the raw crystal spell is upgraded, it is easier to merge the changes if we only mark exactly what changed.

  <msg spk="Tanya">I'm sorry. But here is the second crystal. Illuminate.</msg>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [8:44 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Illumination shows 7 differences between the Guardian Crystal and its raw form.
  <msg spk="Zoey">7 XD This feels like a joke!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> The heroes finished marking it in no time.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's judge the guardian crystal first. Its changes are probably irrelevant. Then we don't have to worry about it. We will all look at it at once. If you can tell what it is for then say it.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> The first one who understands get the EXP?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Sure. Here is the first one.
  <div></div><div class="">üõéÔ∏è</div><b>Zoey:</b> It is related! Not to the Serpent, but to the Barrier Backup Generator!
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I agree. Here is the second.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I can't tell üè≥Ô∏è XD
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> How do we tell if it is related?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We don't have a procedure.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I read the change comments but it was not obvious. üòñ
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> How about we look at all of them to see if there is any pattern?
  <div></div><div class="">üõéÔ∏è</div><b>Sasha:</b> The last change is related to Barrier Backup Generator!
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I agree.
  <div></div><div class="">üõéÔ∏è</div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think the remaining changes are for shutting down leylines to the cave when the Serpent is detected.
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I disagree. I think they are also for the Backup Generator. Here is the evidence.
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Tanya shows sage comments about the Backup Generator in Elvish.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I'm sorry. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It's okay. Apparantly the sister crystal has two more hovering barriers, which we don't have.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I thought we don't need any magic circle for the gravity guards.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> And now we see seeming contradicting evidence. We need to investigate.
  <div></div><div class="">üõéÔ∏è</div><b>Sasha:</b> There is no evidence that we need magic circles. If we disregard the other two floating objects we don't have, the remaining changes in the guardian crystal add two leylines to keep something afloat. Our Backup generator is based on another area that is more similar. If we want to check, we should check that crystal, not this one. So I would conclude that none of these changes are relevant or are good references for us.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Zoey, could you identify what area our backup generator was based on?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Found it XD. That area uses a standard guardian crystal.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We should probe further to confirm that its main crystal does not need changes. Otherwise I will just add 4 quest hours for a subquest to confirm later.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I say let's do it. XD
  <msg spk="Ledia">I am about OOM for this type of task. I don't think I can help much but I'll stay.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think in that case it is better to just full rest. There is nothing urgent going on. Even if we find something you can do, you can do it tomorrow.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Alright then.</msg>
  <mbkudo><b>Tanya thanks all for helping.</b></mbkudo>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> We checked the history and trials of the fhird sister crystal. We found no evidence that there is a magic circle for the backup generator.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> This means we don't need to modify our guardian crystal. The next step for Serpent Cave is to judge relevant changes in its main crystal.

  Arx Catacomb</small></center><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>There</b> is an interesting idea going on at Arx Catacomb, can we make it happen?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> By my conscious decision, @Detectives does not keep a todo list. Every week or so I try to report what issue we solved or look for something with an issue.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> This week I see Tanya tried to update Arx Catacomb. There is a really interesting idea there, representing each logical fallacy has zombies, and imagining the viewer is going through a dungeon.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> But I imagine that it will be really hard to pull off. Unless we have actually played it.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So I propose that we actually take some time to design that game and play it. And by doing so, we could review some concepts we learned from reading FATE Accelerated and FATE Core.
  <msg spk="Sasha">What do you think?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I am glad that you like the idea. Help is welcomed and requested.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I am stuck trying to present it as a story.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I was trying to avoid simply listing the fallacies because it would be too dry.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But it was still too dry when I tried to present it as a story.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think you should first make a dry list, then we can discuss what zombie or monster the fallacy should be. Since the list has 24 fallacies, if they are all zombies might be too repetitive.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So I propose these steps:
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> 1) Make a section in Arx where you just list all the fallacies with a link to what they mean. Then...
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> 2) We'll discuss what zombie/monster they are.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> 3) When we have a good number of them defined, we will start an actual game going through the dungeon.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Question: If we all understand the fallacies, then we are already trained. Then in the game, we won't be using the fallacies, how do we give examples?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> There are plenty of examples if we go online.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I'm fine if if we don't have to use fallacies just for demonstration XD
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Someone is really confident.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> On the other hand I can't gaurantee. üòñ May I see the list of fallacies?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> We are talking about this list of .
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Timeout. Let's list all of them in Arx first, before continuing the discussion.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Okay üòä
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [11:44 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Step 1 completed.
  <mbrec>Sasha is recognized for the Magician Skill Timeout.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I set it to Magician. Not trying to hijack your thread. Please continue.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Congratulations to me!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Any idea on the monsters?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I see Special Pleading as a ghost type monster. They keep dodging, it is hard to hit.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I agree.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I'm adding that note as comments in the html code for now because other it will look super messy without proper formatting.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think you can show it in parentheses. It is easier when we think about it after the discussion.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Good call.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Then Loaded Question should be Jack-o'-Lantern that can explode.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Super appropriate!</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I'm really liking this theme. It can be our Halloween Special. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It sounds really fun. üòä</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Then can Strawman be a Shadow Reaper? Instead of attacking the hero, it can deal damage by attacking the hero's shadow.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Sounds like a Boss. I like it. üòÅ</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I see we lost the original zombie. How about Band Wagon is the Zombie. And it comes in a horde.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I second that, seems fitting.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> How about Appeal to Emotion be a crying girl? They lure the heroes into traps.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Good one!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Should we keep going or should we stop?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> @Ivy would you like to pick one?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I would see Fallacy Fallacy as a moving suit of armor that is overly strict.
  <msg spk="Ledia">I can picture it.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Should we continue tomorrow when there are more people online? It is late and I think it might be a good idea if everyone who remotely wants to play gets a chance to define a monster.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> That's a good idea, maybe Sylvia would be interested.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> We have plenty options left, should I cast a flare tomorrow? XD
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We need a proper URL to cast a flare.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I'll do that tomorrow. Consider it done XD
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Thank you all for helping. It was very helpful.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Thank you for the great idea!
  <mbkudo><b>Tanya thanks the group for making the game together.</b></mbkudo>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I want to add a pudding monster.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> There goes the theme! XD
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think it would be fun if you summon puddings to fight monsters. So puddings are on our side.
  <msg spk="LRRH">Okay.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Nice save, Evelyn.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Did Zoey just use Slippery Slope? Yes or No?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I would say... Yes? For all we know, a pudding monster <i>could</i> have a halloween theme. And halloween is somewhat about sweets, if we go for a more E rated theme with lighter tone.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think that is a good point. Candy monsters would actually fit and it would be cute. üòÉ
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> ü§î
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Cardinal, Activate Catacomb Protocol!
  <mbdmg>Zoey used Logical Fallacy: Slippery Slope and takes 1 damage.</mbdmg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> What monster is Slippery Slope?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Can that be the pudding monster?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I was thinking it would be a slime monster because it is slippery, but I can also see slime, jelly, and pudding being the same monster type.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think the situation is not whether the pudding can be the monster, but that it <b><i>was</i></b> the monster that Zoey fell for and took 1 damage.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> It is official! I got attacked by a pudding. I added it to the list. XD
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> The pudding monster looks firm, but once it is hit it turns runny makes it really slippery and heroes would fall into traps.
  <msg spk="Zoey">It is a bait XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is cute, I like it. üòä</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Should I change @Concept to @Catacomb? I think that would be a more fun charter code.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Then what about @Dungeon? If we are going to lighter tone. @Catacomb is darker.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think @Dungeon is more fun.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, could you make the change to @Dungeon?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> It's done! Please update the charter when you have time!
  <msg spk="Tanya">Thank you.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> @Cardinal, @StarTree, want to define monster?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree is now thinking!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Vampires for Genetics.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Perfect choice!</msg>
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> This is too hard for StarTree!
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> StarTree, what monster do you picture in the dungeon?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Fungi and spores! They hallucinate the heroes slowly so the heroes have no idea!
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Maybe Appeal to Nature?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> That seems like the best fit. But for Appeal to Nature I would picture a mana fountain that is actually a foutain of poison.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> That could be the result of hallucination.
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree doesn't have good ideas!
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think that was a good idea. Nothing else so far would be constantly there and become unnoticed. That is unique.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sylvia:</b> What about a mimic? The treasure chest monster. The heroes might get used to looting and seeing treasure chests. But they are not all good.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> What fallacy do you want that to be?
  <div></div><b>Sylvia:</b> Composition/Division.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I can sort of see that.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Now I also have a second idea. üòñ
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> About something new or something that already has a monster?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Something new. üòñ
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think it should be fine, I am out of ideas anyway.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> What are you all doing? Who wants to go treasure hunting?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> We are coming up with monster ideas to represent logical fallacies. Would you like to add an idea?
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> How about False Levers that look like they are for the door but sets off traps? For False Cause.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> No dungeon is complete without a lever or two.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> But is a lever a monster? ü§î
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Does it have to be a monster?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That's Zoey's prompt. I think anything that can defeat the heroes is okay.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Added, but I'll leave the title for now because I don't know what to change it to. XD
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Could we continue after treasure hunt?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> We don't need to define all of them before moving to Step 3. I think we have enough ideas, so we should fresh out what the game is. When we come back, could we move on to Step 3: Starting a game? We can still take further ideas as we play.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I want to at least start a game before the weekend is over.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I'm fine with that. üòä
  <mbkudo><b>Zoey thanks all for the lesson XD</b></mbkudo>

  Arx Dungeon</small></center><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>For</b> the first training exercise, my plan was to go online and spot examples of people using a logical fallacy. 
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> The purpose of this training is to be aware of them so we don't use logical fallacy. Then we can train on what to do when it is used against us or against someone else.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Does the context of the argument matter?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That is up to you.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Hold on a second. I had an idea on how we present this so it would be fun to read. On this channel, we could just talk and discuss without RP. But this shouldn't be the main story.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In my vision we are doing this mainly for us. My priority is that we are trained and we have fun doing it. Whether someone will have fun reading it is secondary.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I don't want to prioritize them. I think it is better if it is also fun to read, and if we are clear about that goal, even if you call it secondary or a bonus, then we could train in a way that will get both done by going through the exercise once.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think if it is fun for someone else to read then it will be fun for us to read later. I want that if it is not too hard to do. Is there a plan for that?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Can we fix the context of the training? In the story, we are peacemaker heroes, and we are going through the Arx Dungeon. Do our hero characters know that they are fighting monster that represent logical fallacies, or are they trying to clear the dungeon of monsters?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> My undrstanding so far is that our heroes are there to train on how to fight monsters. Whether those monsters are dummy monsters or actual monsters infesting the dungeon is up to the GM.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That was my intent. Our characters are training to fight monsters. The context has nothing to do with logical fallacies.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think if we do that we will miss out too many dialogue about logical fallacies. The story will become a generic dungeon crawl.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I cannot really picture what it means if it is not a generic dungeon crawl. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> How about we start the story as a generic dungeon crawl, where the character believe that they are to clear monsters. But as they progress, they would discover the monster's weak points if they understand their connection to logical fallacies?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think that is not necessary because we defined the monsters using analogy, and the reader already know the relation. For the first training, we are just trying to spot the monsters. For future training, when we try to do something about them, only effective response in real life against those fallacies would give an effective result. We will not be rolling dice to determine the result. We will response in real life, and let what happens in real life be the result.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> And when it works, the player character is recognized for their skill that works, and gets a treasure item.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I got a Fact-check bow. Sorry I forgot what its official name was. XD
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> It was a quiver of fact checking! On Decemmber 9th 2021!
  <msg spk="Zoey">6 months ago XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> And I have a Sanctuary Staff. It was anti zombie, but now zombies are... reapers.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> When the Sanctuary Staff is activated, there is an aura of light so the heroes would have no shadows for reapers to attack.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Okay, so we have two characters who already have been to the dungeon and had gotten treasures: A bow and staff. What is Ledia's story? Did Ledia work at the dungeon?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> In real life yes. In the story maybe. It is hard roleplaying experience when I have no experience about this game dungeon.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Actually how about you tell us a little more about the Arx Dungeon in real life? What were you doing there? What was the purpose?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> The gist is that the Arx Sealing Team seals monsters and evil beings at its vault. We clean them up section by section. There is a huge backlog but it is has many layers of barriers. When a team is ready, we unseal a section and clean it up.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Because of the barriers, it is relatively low risk even if we fail. So practically the whole vault is training ground. It is not particularly stressful working there.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> It sounds like a huge prison.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Yes, except sealeing being are not exactly "alive" while they are seal. They are in the same condition when they were sealed until they are unsealed. All they know is that they were fighting Arx Knight in the field, the Arx Knight casts a spell, and the next thing they know is future Arx Knights waiting for them in full health.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then in this case, it wasn't really an evil wizard trying to invade the catacomb.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> It is not. We put them there.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Could we use the same context? If it is easier for Ledia to keep her story?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That is fine.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Then the rough context is the newer peacemakers Evelyn and Zoey are going to the Arx for training, where Ledia is their guide. Who else is going?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The original concept, and the context was that as Queen Vivi tried to excavate the Cardinal Castle buried underground, Hospitalian Knights joined force with Arx on a mission to clear the closest catacomb site to Cardinal Castle to strengthen defense against Queen Vivi.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We don't want Queen Vivi to take that site and unseal monsters there as her minions.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> So the Hospitalian Knights are in charge there calling for help from known heroes to clear that site.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Do you mean Arx is in charge of the site, but HK is in charge of calling heroes from Panarcadia?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Yes.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> That arrangement might make sense because Arx doesn't normally open their vault for others to level up. And adventurers typically won't accept the terms and conditions there anyway.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> What are the terms and conditions?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> You have to link your soul to Arx Core, so that the Arx and monitor you as you fight the monster and learn your skills. When you fight there you are training yourself and Arx Core. Arx Core has a copy of your soul. It uses that to raise people who dies fighting in the vault.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think we are close to the limit of being E rated.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> That doesn't sound like a bad deal if that makes you practically immortal.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> If we are at the E rating limit, I have to think about whether I can comment on that.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> In the story, Panarcadia heroes can already be raised, so that is not something we need to talk about. We can just assume that every heroes can be raised. There is no motive to join Arx just to be raised.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Agreed. And I am not recruiting here.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Back to the context. In terms of number of players, since the arrangement is that Hospitalian Knights will call on heroes for each chamber they unlock, any hero may just drop in if they think they have the suitable skill to deal with the particular monster.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In the story, the main purpose is to clear the dungeon, not to train the heroes. For our players at the Blogger Guild level, this story exists to train us.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> That is somewhat confusing. We should clearly mark which goal is the non-RP guild goal and which goals are the RP goals.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Noted.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> But overall that is a good description. It should be summarized in the story. My earlier point was this discussion should be a footnote, not what a read will read first when they arrive th Chapter 16.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Let's continue tomorrow with spotting a monster.

  <div class=""><b>The</b> Hospitalian Knights is continuing their mission to clear the Arx Dungeon closest to the buried Cardinal Castle. At the command post there, Tanya looks for the next monster to clear.
  <msg spk="Tanya">For this thread, I want to try a convention where we use the bubble only for non-RP comments. Please use chat mode only for RP content.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Evelyn reports to the Arx Dungeon to help spot the next monster.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Are we going to Twitter to look for a discussion where a logical fallacy is used?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes, but it doesn't have to be from Twitter. Any source is fine.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Red argues at Twitter so there should be many examples.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I found something, is it okay if I link to it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think that is fine. @LRRH?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">It is okay linking to Twitter when we are not hurting anyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">How is Red related in the story?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Little Red Riding Hood scouts and routinely sends information to the alliance.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">So in this particular 
  <msg spk="LRRH">I wanted to know whether humans are "Frugivorous" and not "omnivorous".</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Evelyn, LRRH, in the story, if you are doing this, you are already in an unsealed chamber. You are exploring the dungeon to tell if there is a monster. Do you want to RP that context?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> When Evelyn arrived Little Red Riding Hood was already exploring the dungeon and found what looks like a treasure chest. So she opens it.
  <msg spk="LRRH">Little Red Riding Hood is the kind of character who would just open chests without defusing traps when she is alone. Because she has Auto-Revive, so in general it doesn't matter if it sets off a trap.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If you do that in the story I think it is better to roll the dice. But my priority is to get to logical fallacies, so the chest opens without issue.</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Inside the chest, there was a . The scroll claims that humans are "Frugivores" which are different from "Omnivores')". Is that the truth?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Red thinks that wouldn't that be convenient if that is the truth? Many animal will be spared if humans learn that they are not supposed to be eating meat.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> From the command post, Evelyn saw that Red had already checked in and caught up to Red.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> "I think we should ask Ivy or Zoey to check the authenticity of the scroll."
  <msg spk="Sasha">Question: Did Evelyn just use Appeal to Authority?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> "I want to confirm the meaning of the term. I am not sure what 'Frugivorous' means. Also, the list show many characteristics, are they the full range of the characteristics in each category, or did the maker of the scroll hide the truth that each category have a wider range of characteristics?"
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I wanted to know whether that list was cherry-picking, but we don't yet have a monster for that. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think since the game is on, if you have an idea for a term that doesn't have a monster, you could just define it even if you had defined some before.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't have an idea for cherry-picking, but I thought Minions could be the monsters for Appeal to Authority.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Bananas?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I meant gargoyles, demon hounds, and other familiars commanded or controlled by some authority like a wizard.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I am looking up what is going on.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey arrives at the dungeon and learns about the situation.
  <msg spk="Sasha">I added Demon Hounds as the monster type because "minions" is not specific enough. The long description includes your other examples.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Thank you.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Any idea on what Cherry-Picking would be?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">How about Skeleton Archers? If you fire an arrow at them, the arrow tends to just go through them, and the pick up your arrows and fire it back.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">That's a pretty good match.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Added.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">And Evelyn didn't use Appeal to Authority. She was just asking for the definition of the terms which presumably both the speaker and a competent listener would agree on.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Sasha, do you agree?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I agree.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">In the story you could say you have fended off some demon hounds.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Ledia arrived at the chamber and saw red growing eyes of demon hounds down a hallway. She skates down the hall at a surprising speed to the hounds and KO'ed them easily.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> That surprised Evelyn also. She had not seen Ledia move like that.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> "These were my skates when I was working at Arx Vault. We used them to skate down long halls of cleared chambers when there were no teleports in between. It was fun."
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Ledia was wearing her Arx uniform, which was described as a battle nun uniform with light armor pieces.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Okay. Fact 1: Frugivore refers to animals that primarily eats raw fruits. It doesn't mean that the animal cannot digest other food, or other foods are harmful.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">What about Omnivorous?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Fact 2: Omnivores refers to animals that are capable of digesting and surviving by eating both plants and animals.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Omnivore describes a being's physiological capability. Being an Frugivore describes a being's diet preference, which might be situational specific to the evironment they live in.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">An Frugivore can either also be a Herbivore or an Omnivore.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">And I found an 
  <msg spk="Tanya">Zoey, how would you describe what your character is doing in the dungeon?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey arrives with another  she retrieve from the archive and started comparing the two.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> "The scroll I brought is long. It might take some time to understand it."
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> "Why don't we skip to the conclusion of the scroll?" Ledia thought and read ahead. The <i>Long</i> scroll made that conveniently possible without disturbing Zoey.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> The conclusion of the scroll Zoey brought stated that humans benefit the most from a mostly plant-based diet, but not strictly herbivore diet. Although their most recent ancestors are frugivores, humans are better adapted for higher starch and higher vegetables diet than higher fruit diet.
  <msg spk="Ledia">So what do we make out of this information if it is true?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">The Twitter 
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> If the scroll Zoey brought is truthful, the one Red found seems to be authentic. But it doesn't say what Red thought it meant.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> The scroll didn't say humans are frugivores.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> What do you call a diet that is high starch and high vegetables?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I can't find a name for that.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think as long as it is reasonably affordable, it is better to minimize harm to other beings. So even if human are evolutionarily carnivores, if we should choose to harm no one if we can.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> If we choose to harm others just because we are evolutionarily adapted to doing so, that would be an argument of Genetics. That is Vampirism.
  <msg spk="Tanya">So far this section is clear. Evelyn, do you want to conclude it?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Satisfied that the scroll Red found was harmless, Evelyn blesses it with an anti-vampirism spell. 
    <div class=""><center><i><b>May our conscience guide us to goodness free from inherited habits.</b></i></center></div>
  <mbrec>Evelyn is recognized for Cleric Skill Anti-Vampire Enchantment.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="Sasha">We didn't identify an actual fallacy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But we did vet a piece of information and prevented misuse of it. We are preventing ourselves from arguing veganism from an evolutionary point of view. I think that is a good result.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think as a result, the enchantment Evelyn put on the scroll is worth more than the scroll itself.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think the information from the scroll is interesting and informative also. An I am sure people put a lot of effort to do the survey and science to obtain that comparison. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But in terms of a logical argument for veganism, the focus on not hurting others is more important than what we are made of.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes. If anyone here tried to conclude that "Because humans are closer to frugivores therefore humans should eat fruits", then it would either be Appeal to Genetics or Appeal to Nature. Evelyn protected the group before the group was attacked.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Clerics don't get enough credits when they have no idea what issues they prevented with just words. Evelyn is worth more than she thinks of herself.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">That's very kind of you two. üòä</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> I want to know how they get their credits.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Is it that important?
  <msg spk="Vivi">You asked. So I answered.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Fair enough.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I want to know people's wishes.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> That was on the membership form.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I think the profile should have the levels the character has. And those levels shouldn't be higher than then overall level. You did that for the profile cards. They should be on the main profile.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I could start with their contributions, then their wishes, followed by their level allocations. This has no resemblence to FATE.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I think only you know FATE here.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I only care about the scores. I thought you were going to update a person every week.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> We already did the top scorers. Who else do you want to know?
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> @StarTree, who is the next top scorer that we hadn't profiled?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> It is StarTree! Ranking 4th in the guild! Score distribution: 38% Daily Quest, 33% Guild Quest, 29% Cardinal. StarTree is the score leader of @Board!
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I want something more helpful. What is your average score per day in June?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> It is 8.3!
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Vivi:</b> In that case, I want you to put three stars for Daily Quest and Guild Quest, and two stars for Cardinal Quest.
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Like this?

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I want to give StarTree an Admin badge at her profile.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> That doesn't help me, unless you want StarTree to handle all administrative tasks.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> It is not about authority but recognition.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I think I got what I want for now. So I won't comment on what you want.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> StarTree, I think I asked for your wish before but you didn't have one. Has it changed?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree doesn't have a wish!

  <msg spk="Ledia">That is so true.</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Should there be a fellow member comments section?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> There shouldn't be, otherwise you would have to write something nice for everyone.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Why is that a problem?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> When you run out of genuine comments, it will show and it will make people feel bad.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think we should aim to have fun and make fond memories together. If we can see who is left out, then it make us want to include them and do something for them.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think that's the way to go.

  <div class=""><b>For</b> Philosophy Arena, I want to setup a championship. The contestants would be different philosphies, and each contestant may post a situation for other philosophies to solve.
  <msg spk="Fina">Each contestant can propose their best solution for the situation.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then other contestant may find flaws of their solution, for example, when they propose a solution that uses something contradicting their principle.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> In this post I want to discuss the scoring in order to determine the champion.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> About the scoring: A contestant gets one point for providing a solution according to their principles to the prompt.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Next, the solution gets extra points based on the ranking scale at Seed of Peace. That is +0 for Conquest, +1 for Control, +2 for Compete, +3 for Coexist, +4 for Cooperate, +5 for Celebrate.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> As you see, the scale is set to favor Celebrate as the highest ranking. Those who want Conquest to get the most points could make a different ranking.
  <div></div><div class="" does that answer score 5 points?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> No, because that reaction does not stop the conquest, so the resulting solution type is still conquest. That is +0.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> If I say: "My country will defend itself" then what is my score?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> For what reason are people in your country defending the country? For example, if you say they must fight or be executed, then your solution is still +0.
  <msg spk="Vivi">That answered my question.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think this is easier to understand than what we started in the manga. üòÉ
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> But if each contestant may only have one question, it will be really hard to pick a question to start.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Each contestant can propose multiple questions, but they may only choose one for the scoring.
  <msg spk="Fina">So when they think of a situation where they can score higher, they would write it up and swap the prompt.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">If they are already at +5 for their prompt, they can try to come up with another prompt where other contestants will score lower.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> That's a good method, there's no need to hold back posting new prompts. üëç
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> Naturally, I will be a contestant for Stewardism. I am not going to ask anyone else to participate. Buf if no one else participates, Stewardism will show as the sole champion.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> In the manga I played for communism, but I don't really understand it. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> If you want you can play as "What Evelyn thinks Communism is" until a more knowledgeable contestant takes your place and answers the prompts for you.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Or you could cite arguments people make when they promote communism. XD
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think I should first consider whether I want to roleplay that at all. üòÖ
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> If our aim is not to rank existing philosophies than it shouldn't matter whether communism is a contestant. I will compete as Hospitalian.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then we are fighting among ourselves. XD
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Not necessarily. In this scoring system, we could draw.
  <mbaa>Tanya receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe I should play as Arcacian? üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Yes you should. Arcacian Ambassador.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> The nomination was a setup for the challenge! XD
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÑ</msg>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> So who wants to set the stage at Chapter 23?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Nothing gets done at Chapter 23 when Fina can't boss 3B around XD
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I guess I could try formatting the page. Although I can't promise that it will look very good. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> If it doesn't I'll let you know.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Okay. Thank you. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> It should be the other way around. Fina is so ungrateful. XD
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> I am being grateful enough for coming once a while. I don't need to be here at all.
  <msg spk="Zoey">That's ... true. üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I'm sorry, Fina! We've been slacking so much and didn't follow through with what you taught us since... Chapter 4. I will start making the Arena right away. Thank you for your invaluable guidance! We're very grateful for your visits! üòñüôè
  <msg spk="Fina">That's more like it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">OMG I feel sorry for Evelyn. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then help her build Arena. This is your guild, you are from the same team.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It is so mean but kind of right at the same time XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> It is completely right. I expect visible result for us to comment on in this thread.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I feel like now I know what happened to 3B XD
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I want to laugh but... but...
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> It's too late. Go help your team. And that other cat who is still reading this.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> This is not my forte. I also need help at @Dungeon.
  <msg spk="Fina">Excuse accepted.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> It's so unfair!
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> It's okay Sasha, I'll laugh in your place. Mhahahahaha!!
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD ü§£</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Fina, how is this? We added numbers on the left for the scores. The next step is to fill it with principles and post challenge questions.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Good.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> I nominated Chapter 23 for best scoreboard.
  <msg spk="StarTree">What is the highlight of the nomination?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> I nominate it for the brilliant style combining score, title, participants and a bright color code. We had not have a team scoreboard. This is the first.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Copy!</msg>

  <div class=""><b>We</b> are missing something that show dependencies of subquests for Cardinal Quest. So I propose adding something in the planner to show dependencies.
  <msg spk="Sasha">However, I forgot what it was that I saw to have such dependencies. Anyone remember what it was?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Are you talking about Sapphire 898? We might need to craft that into a shield.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes. That, and more.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Don't <i>ALL</i> of them have dependencies? We are waiting for many crafting materials.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> There are two kinds of dependencies. The ones where we wait for something done so we can finish the quest, and the ones where we need to tell someone else to do something so they can do their part before we can finish the quest.
  <msg spk="Sasha">I was talking about the second type.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> They are both important
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We need to tell others when they are behind, and we also need to tell ourselves when we are behind. It is the same problem.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Technically I don't care when someone else is behind. But I get your point. And we <i>should</i> care.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's redo the back calculation first because the one on the planner is outdated.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The updated handover date is July 22.
  <msg spk="Zoey">How did we get a month extension? XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">With help from Hospitalian Knights.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Hospitalian Knights--Our Deus Ex Machina. XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class="" would be a good Aspect for Tanya.
  <msg spk="Tanya">It is not the time to celebrate yet.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> No that won't be good enough because it is not double edged. It should be something like, <hl>"We are in debt to Hospitalian Knights."</hl> or something.
  <msg spk="Ledia">That does sound better. It is more playable.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Order! Order! XD</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Okay. So by the grace of Hospitalian Knights, the handover date is postponed to July 22, and I edited the planner with new dates for the quest hour bins.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> I heard that some of the crafting materials won't arrive until July 20.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> This is beyond what I wanted to talk about originally, but let's first put all the known material arrival dates on the planner.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Now, on to what I wanted to talk about.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Should we go through each spawn point?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Let's start with the Sapphire Shield, then maybe the Ruby 948 if we have time left.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> For the Shield, we are waiting for a template, and we need to learn how to enchant. We also need to know how to enchant for Exchange and Shaft spawn points.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Please wait while I summarize the steps on the planner.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> It is not too hard having it somwhere on the planner. Should I spread it out on specific dates instead of having it outside the schedule?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> How about make a dummy bin after this Friday and put them there. Then it is close enough so we will see it every day, and easy to move sub quests we don't finish this week.
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's a great idea!</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> With that, the Planner became slightly more useful!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Sasha, I've just realized that the planner is really a Quest Journal.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I can see that somewhat, but it would need to look much nicer for me to call that a Quest Journal. Right now it is more like a quest list.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Casey:</b> I am planning to upgrade @Treasure to have information and stories per location. I could do Arsenal mines first.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think that will be useful.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Go for it, Casey! üëç

  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> The reason of this change is to accidental jumps, especially on mobile because it is not obvious where the jumps are, and our site is missing the function to undo a jump to return to the same view.

  Cardinal Core</small></center><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>We</b> have been reading the FATE game system for a while now. One of its main concept is fate points. To summarize, fate points are used like mana to power up skill and change the course of the story. Your earn them by letting your character get into complications. That system sets FATE apart from other systems, and Cardinal Core doesn't have that concept. Should Cardinal Core have that concept?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> To me, fate points are like the rage bar in a fighting game. When your character takes hits, their rage bar charges up, then you can unleash super moves. It is a mechanism that allows the underdog to overcome, thus creates dramatic results.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> It feels strange if we intentionally put ourselves in a pinch. üòÖ
  <msg spk="Sasha">You also get fate points for being in-character.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">No, I think only when your being in-character leads to a complication. If you are just being in-character in a good way, you don't get fate points.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> For example, when Evelyn enters a dungeon she casts Protect. That is in-character but she won't get fate points for that, unless we were told we shouldn't cast protect but she did it out of habit anyway. Then if she accept that she would mess up in that situation, she gets a fate point.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think if we simply play in-character, we don't really need fate points to be in-character. We would already mess up naturally. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Like that time when Ledia tried to cast chain lightning in Arsenal. üòâ
  <msg spk="Ledia">But I didn't get anything for being entertaining.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">But I think it was funny because it was genuine. You weren't trying to create drama. It was you. üòä</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> And for being entertaining, you would get a moment for your profile.
  <msg spk="Ledia">True.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So I see one against fate points. Is there anyone FOR it?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> In boss fights, it is easy to get into a situation where the heroes are low on mana. so the end of the fight simply drags on, as we only have basic attacks left. The end of a fight is usually, "That was a long fight, thank god it is over."
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Fate points is a way to change that. If we don't use fate points, what else can we use?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> For the Hellapagos boss fight, there was a round limit. If the heroes couldn't finish the boss, the boss escapes and the heroes lose. At the last round, the heroes would just have to invent new ways to cooperate and stack up their advantages to make the final blow.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think it did fine making it a team effort.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> The way I remembered it was we tried to be too dramatic but the dice didn't work out. It might be easier if we just hacked on it with basic attacks instead of trying to combo. XD
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> 3B was trying to draw lightning to nuke the boss. I don't remember exactly why that didn't work. I don't remember how the fight ended.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> It was the dice XD
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think what happened was, when the boss is close to KO'ed, Cardinal followed the dice more faithfully. The heroes need to stack up the advantages more.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> It's too long ago I don't remember XD
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I remembered Vivi comboed with light for Shadow Bind.
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Yes that was awesome.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So do we have a conclusion about the rage gauge?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> My conclusion is that the players need to remember that if they don't think hard, the drag at the end will happen. That drag is realistic. Everyone is tired and out of mana. How do you keep the opportunity and end the quest? That is part of the challenge to the players.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> If we go by a rage gauge mechanism, then Evelyn won't need to cast Protect and we would all be more reckless than who we really are. We'll all be out of character.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think if we are playing in-character, our character won't be able to consider or talk about "fate points" because they don't make sense inside the story. I can understand it if I helped someone and they gave me magic item that I can use in a pinch. I can't understand if I need to put my character in a pinch to gain an advantage later. There is no causality in the story. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Ledia?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I do enjoy the fact that we are already playing in character. I don't think fate points would make us play out of character because you can only get fate points by being in character. I guess what I might be asking, is that good roleplayers get an advantage or bonus until they use it in the session. Then when it comes to a fight, they can use those bonus when their die roll is bad. I understand that this has nothing to do with casuality.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Instead of simply rewarding drama, the GM could reward relevant behavior. For example, an observant character can see where they can get an advantage in the surrounding. And they become recognized as an observant character by paying attention and be observant during other parts of the story. Then their leveling up their observant skill and their being able to use that skill to get advantages would make sense.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> That's quite compelling. I don't have further arguments
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Okay. So far we are mostly against using fate points because it breaks causality. Should we keep reading fate? we are at about page 80/300.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think the parts about aspect is helpful.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think we can skim through many parts because we don't need to know <i>how</i> to play FATE if we aren't adopting its mechanisms. I think our dice mechanism with advantages is simpler.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think that's good enough for now. In the meantime we could look for the next thing to read.
  <mbkudo><b>Sasha thanks the group for feedbacks.</b></mbkudo>

  <div class=""><b>The</b> guild has a situation. It is not exactly an emergency, but some of you want to be in the know, so this is the thread.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>James:</b> Here is the situation. Someone stopped paying rent since May. By July it will be the third month. So we are about to start the first step of an eviction process, which is a formal notice to them that they need to pay or we might evict them.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Why didn't they pay rent?
  <div></div><b>James:</b> They say their relative is trying close a property sale, so they are waiting for a big sum of money before they can pay.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't understand this. Are they buying a property or selling a property?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Does it matter? It is not an emergency. They did it out of greed or convenience. They are taking advantage of other people. They have no excuse.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> It is not charity if someone cheats out of greed and you just forgive them.
  <div></div><b>James:</b> To answer Tanya's question: I think the context is that their relative is selling a property. They will get a large sum of money when the sale closes. In the meantime there may be legal fees and realtors they need to pay.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I know it is late, but if they had asked would we have lent them money for closing the sale?
  <div></div><b>James:</b> Probably not. We're not in a business of lending money.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I agree with Fina that this is not okay. It is not honest if you help someone by cheating someone else.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> If they pay after receiving the notice. Can they stay?
  <div></div><b>James:</b> It might depend on how they pay.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> If they were willing to cheat, there should be better renters.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I feel that if you serve the notice, it would be a huge escalation.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> But the notice doesn't actually do anything.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> It is the opposite. <i>They</i> escalated. We are showing them how to de-escalate.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> But if they are telling the truth, then they have no money to pay in the short term. This will create a lot of panic.
  <mbcomplete>Little Red Riding Hood has just served the notice.</mbcomplete>

  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">How did it go?</msg>

  <div class=""><b>How</b> does your philosophy deal with housing shortage? Does it try to house everyone? How does it do so?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">These questions is for the challenge question at Arena. I hope that the format is correct.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I am posing it for Arcacianism.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> When someone needs housing, Arcacianism reimburses and rewards those who choose to help. The result is that the person in need gets housing without being in debt, and the helpers get rewarded with credits that they may or may not choose to exchange for other rewards at quest centers.
  <msg spk="Fina">What rank are you aiming for?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Celebration. Arcacianism celebrates those who help others. If you help people by building houses for them, you get many Arcacian points. Your good deeds are on public record.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> Stewardism simply keep access open so people who need housing may build by themselves. They could get help if they want, but there is no system to promote help. Stewardism does not keep record of people's good deeds, but it reacts against those laying waste and blocking fair access. I'd rank Stewardism at Coexistence for this question.
  <msg spk="Sasha">I don't get it. Why didn't you just say Stewardism celebrates those who can build their own houses? Then you'll get 5 points.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Stewardism by itself doesn't say that being self-sufficient is something to be celebrated. It is anti-villains but does not promote heroism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">You're going really soft against Evelyn.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then come join the fight.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> I want to join as a contestant. What do I need to do?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> What philosophy are you representing?
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Dictatorship, World Domination.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Any difference to imperialism?
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> That's for you to decide. In Queen Vivism, the world belongs to Queen Vivi. Queen Vivi has the final authority to decide who deserves to have a house and resources allocated accordingly to her liking as the world celebrates her infinite wisdom.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I propose this as a celebration rank solution. I dare anyone to disagree.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I disagree. Isn't this the definition of Conquest rank solution? You just said you decide who deserves to have a house. So, what do you do when you decide that someone who has a house doesn't have one?
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Queen Vivi does not feel a need to reply to non-contestants.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Zoey come join Stewardism.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I feel that I should be neutral for now.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Why would anyone want to join Stewardism when your answer is only mid-ranked?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> This is Stewardism to Vivism: Stewardism does not take away livelihood of neutral beings. That is the requirement for a philosophy to reach the rank of Coexistence. Vivism as described violates Coexistence. It is at most competition rank.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Objection. I never said I would take away livelihood. I said I get to decide who deserves to live in a house.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> You are not denying that you would not take away people livelihood as you see fit. Unless you declare that Queen Vivism does not give Queen Vivi the authority to make such decisions, your objection is meaningless. It is implied that you also have that authority even if you don't say it explicitely.
  <msg spk="Vivi">Sasha?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Sasha can't think of a comeback against Fina's argument. üè≥Ô∏è</msg>
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> This is Queen Vivism to Stewardism: Does Stewardism declare that they will never do anything that harms or ends the livelihood of another neutral organism for their own interest? Do you hunt indiscriminately all living things that hunt others? Or do you play favorism and let some of those hunters off the hook?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Stewardism doesn't force anyone to enforce Stewardism values. If you don't fight for the rights of other being, that just makes you less of a Stewardist.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I claim that Stewardism also violates the requirement for Coexist unless it declares Stewardism bans pulling weeds from a garden and building roads over vegetations.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Stewardism follows sustainability, and that is better than Vivism which would not only pave roads over plants but dead human rebels.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Vivi, you can't win arguments against Fina. I'm speaking as an oracle.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Queen Vivi does not response to non-contestants.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Hospitalianism promotes necessary housing by letting hospitable places get more resources based on net migration. When people with no housing migrate to a place they find more hospitable (such as a place the provides the kind of housing and community they want), their resources rights travel with them to the new place.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Hospitalian solution to housing is cooperation ranked.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Vivism to Hopistalianism: How is Hospitalianism not ranked at Competition? That housing solution does not promote different states to cooperate. It is promoting them to compete against each other.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Hospitalianism promotes people in a country to cooperate with people trying to migrate to their country. People who share the same problem of needing housing
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> That doesn't change the relationship among the countries. They are clearly in comeptition against each other.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> @Fina, how is competition rank defined?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Compeition rank is defined as solutions that allow losers to lose their livelihood. It is defined for individuals, not organizations. There is no problem "killing" an organization when it lacks members.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Therefore, Hospitalianism is above competition rank. Unlike Stewardism, Hospitalianism has an incentive for people to be hospitable to others.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I contest the conclusion that Hospitalianism promotes people helping each other because the added resource follows the migrant. The local helpers don't actually get anything.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That is not how it normally works. The local helpers are not providing hospitality entirely free of charge. They could have a tax or duty schedule where a migrant is allowed to join only if they pay a due. But the migrant is free to choose any country to join or be independent. Most people would rather pay a fee for a comfortable and safe life than to invent and defend their life all by themselves.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Hospitalianism is not much different from choosing which hotel you want to stay in, when you also have a choice to camp. You don't have to choose a hotel.
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> Without further arguments, the scores for this challenge question are: Arcacianism 5 points, Hospitalianism 4 points, Stewardism 3 pts, Queen Vivism 0 pt.
  <msg spk="Zoey">With this scoring system, won't the score stay the same for every question?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> That's for you to find out.

  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think this might be a bad practice if we log items at the guild log, but we actually ignore them when we have time to do something.
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree is doing it wrong! üò≠</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> What is the oldest quest logged there?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Red logged something about Big Bad Wolf on August 23, 2021!
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> That has nothing to do with @Board. Red was asking the question what constitutes bullying and how should society react to it. I can't tell exactly where it should go. Maybe @Seed or @Arena or @Paladin? But it is definitely not an @Board quest.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> @Arena can take that as a challenge question.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Thank you!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> @Board has unrelated quests because at one point the quests did not have proper chapter assignment. So they were all set to @Board to be assigned.
  <msg spk="Ledia">That explains it.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> We categorized the remaining quests at @Board. The categories are:
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> <b>Coding:</b> Where someone needs to learn more about coding to upgrade the blog.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> <b>Style:</b> Where someone needs to figure out what changes can make the blog nicer.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> <b>Archive:</b> Importing content from old Google Slides.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> <b>Celebrate:</b> Celebrate most liked posts at Twitter.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> <b>Guide:</b> A guide for ourselves on how to write our own chapters.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> <b>Scoring:</b> Rules on scoring for the guild
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> <b>Milestone:</b> A quest on publishing a newsletter.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> @Guild will take Scoring and Milestone quests.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think @Freedom can take the Archival quest.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> That leaves tracking most liked posts at Twitter to be an odd quest for @Board.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think @Happy can take that quest.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Now the quest list of @Board has a clear focus on the blog. It collects ideas on good styles, it upgrades the code, and it shows the rest of us how to upgrade on own chapters.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think the Guide quest is the easiest to clear. We should clear that first, so everyone knows the known ways to make their chapters better, then do Style. Style Quests will tell us what code we need to upgrade.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Sounds like a great plan.
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> It think this turns out to be a great topic for @Detective. So I am tagging it.
  <mbrec>Ledia is recognized for the skill Battle Master.</mbrec>

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> You could present the treasure as it own game item card. You could see Chapter 20\Archetype\Herlad\Flare for example.
  <msg spk="Casey">Nice!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> What should I really put for the rarity?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Rarity has no meaning in Cardinal Quest. Instead we should know how much it costs to use it.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Should this shield block magical or physical attack? If it blocks physical attacks, how is it different from an ordinary shield?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> It blocks physical attack, but it absorbs more impact the more it blocks the same attack.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Normally blocking takes 1 stamina. If the incoming attack is notably impactful, then it becomes a contest of strength between the attacker and the blocker, assuming the shield doesn't break.
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> For this shield, the property would be after the first block against an attack type, there is no strength check against that same attack type for subsequent blocks.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Is it per fight or permanent?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> It is permanent per user.
  <msg spk="Ledia">So what happens if the user is KO'ed and someone else tries to use the shield?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">The new user cannot take advantage of the KO'ed user's experience.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> But does the shield now start leveling up with the new user and remembers the level with the old user?
  <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> It remembers. <hl>It works with summoner skills so that you could summon another hero's experience for the shield to block for you.</hl>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I like that idea. Even though I have no summoner skill.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">You can learn it XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Even if we don't try to add a rarity label, the way Cardinal described it would make the shield unique. Each shield has it own memory.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> But it is irrelevant whether "Sapphire Shields" are rare, but <i>the one you used</i> is unique.
  <msg spk="Casey">I don't have a better word for it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Could we call that type of items legendary? If what makes it special is the experience it has.
  <msg spk="Casey">I'd take that.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think you need a section to define what "legendary" and "gear" mean, as opposed to other keywords.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I think they can go to @Cardinal
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it is more relevant here.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">How about both? With JQuery?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Alright. But not now. I have another question.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> So we have a card for the treasure.I think something should be done about the quest to get that treasure. How do we get that treasure?
  <msg spk="Zoey">We will know when we actually get it! XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, could you list field log entries we did for Sapphire Shield?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Done! There is a key material, the Sapphire, that had not been obtained because it is not clear if enchantment are compatible or need to be merged!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> That reminds me that we need to ask the sages something about it. üòñ
  <msg spk="Ledia">I already asked the crafters guild about it. They said they are looking into it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think we should also ask the elves about it. It is the other side of the compatibility question. You were asking whether sapphire enchantment is the only thing we need. I am asking whether we could de-enchant an existing enchantment at the slot so we don't need to merge them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Ok.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Ok, I asked the question.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Can we represent the requirement in simple Quest terms? Such as go to location X, defeat Y, obtain Z, then craft W ?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Well, we know the location. That is Sapphire mine shaft 8 level 9 chamber 8.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> And what is there?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> It is a whole dungeon there XD
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> What monster type is the boss?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> It gave us so much trouble it better be something big.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> But we haven't seen it yet. It could be something innocent. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Who has that skill that can identify what monsters are in a dungeon?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Isn't that Ledia?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I have monster recognition. It means if I see a monster during a fight I can tell what elemental affinity it has. I can't tell what monsters are in a dungeon. I think that would be an Orcale skill.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I've got just the right thing! Oracle cards! And I see...
  <msg spk="Sasha">A Blue Dragon that is immune to percing and lightning attacks!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I hope that we are not attacking creatures at their home for no reason. üòñ
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then let's say it is evil.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I hope that we are not making creatures evil just so that we can fight them. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Evelyn, you're making this really difficult.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> It is a challenge. We have to show our worth then be rewarded with the required sapphire.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I like that better. üòä</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> But once you get the sapphire, you can pass it to anyone? That doesn't make sense.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> The creature can see how it is used and revoke its enchantment
  <msg spk="Ledia">I'm okay with that.</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> It is much better than before.
  <msg spk="Tanya">@StarTree, screenshot please.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Done!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> This style setting is great, it looks good on both desktop and mobile.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I can't wait to for us to complete some treasure quests so we could do the story content.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I nominate that to be best layout to show a card.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Actually, maybe also for best About tab. Casey moved the charter down. That kep the Start tab more interesting.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I thnk Enemble has the best format right now. On desktop, my Start section would have a large blank space. Maybe I should move charter back.
  <msg spk="Casey">Oh wait. I can't. My avatar is transparent. It will look strange.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Chapter 21 is now listed for Best Card Display!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Do you plan to let a visitor play the challenge? Or is it for story only?
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> I only plan for showing the story so when we play the game we have a reference to look up what the treasure and dungeon was about.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. For Arx Dungeon I want it to have a quiz feature. But I think that should be another thread.</msg>

  <msg spk="Ledia">In the first post, comparing shouting down someone to punching someone was an exaggeration and probably not a helpful analogy.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">But is it at fault of any logical fallacy?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Maybe Appeal to Emotion? The exaggeration was meant to connect something that is unknown (shouting down someone) to something that is clear (punching someone). Then somehow use that association for the argument.</msg>

  <msg spk="Sasha">How about an Evil Twin? You know one of them is correct, the question is whether the other is also correct.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">How about a Doppelganger? Who is impersonating one of us?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like that idea, but how exactly do we decide what we are seeing right now?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think it comes down to, do you want the situation to be us, the heroes seeing two things that just look <i>similar</i>, or seeing something that looks <i>familiar</i> but might be different?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think Ledia's idea is more interesting. What is the difference betwen "Evil Twin" and "Doppelganger"?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Well an Evil Twin is evil. A doppelganger could just be mischevous.</msg>

  <msg spk="Ledia">That's a good question.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I would say no. Tanya didn't forbid Sasha from telling anyone. Tanya is just saying she won't adopt Sasha's idea.</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">Do you mean that if Sasha were the GM right now, we will get to know what the idea is?</msg>

  <msg spk="Ledia">Referring to the post, it said that shouting down someone is a coercive method to stifle discussion. Whether it is "coercive" is debatable, but in that situation, it is undenably stifling discussion.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So even if it used a false analogy, I wouldn't focus on it. Shouting down someone strifles discussion. That's a fact. Is strifling discussion the same as violating free speech?</msg>

  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> This is some progress, but still a long way from what we need.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I thought you only need one thing and the quest is complete if you want to stop there. Anything else is really not necessary.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In that case, what monster or what issue are we dealing with?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> The issue is, for some reason someone who should know something is not telling us. So we are left having to figure it out by ourselves.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I hope that we are not asking for something too simple. I hope people are not mad at us for asking. üòñ
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> That was what Vivi was saying...
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Queen Vivi was right. All hail to Queen Vivi!
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Are we RP-ing or not in this thread?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I made it as a non-RP thread to discuss what we should do in the RP.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Based on the result of Arx Dungeon, I want to extend the effort of personalifying issues as monsters to help us deal with them better.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> This is much easier with the logical fallacies. Here we don't even have a word for the situation we are in.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think this is a quest where something is hidden and we are trying to look for it. Once we find it, we can share with others.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Buy in reality we can't just share it with anyone. Or can we?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We'll respect the regional request.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Just to be clear, we could have just said Currency Exchange and Shaft Elevator are both spawn points. They spawn possibly different monsters, but the key to address both is the same. And the key item we need is lost and we need to find it by doing a lot of investigations.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Yes.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ledia:</b> Then in FATE terminology, what we need to overcome are challenges relevant to <hl>Lore, Investigation, and Rapport skills</hl>. In Cardinal terminology, if we are struggling, then our skill ranks are about C. Or maybe even lower.
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's solid! Nice job promoting FATE concepts!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I also think that is a good representation of the situation.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I see. How many skills are there in FATE?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think ? Athetics, Burglary, Contacts, Crafts, Deceive, Drive, Empathy, Fight, Investigate, Lore, Notice, Physique, Provoke, Rapport, Resources, Shoot, Stealth, Will.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I see. Any suggestion on what the key item we are looking for?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Zoey:</b> It is <hl>ancient dwarven runes translator</hl>. There were runes along the elevator shaft, and Currency Exchange square has the same style of runes. It gives us unexpected results when we tested our spells.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I find that to be very accurate, and I like the theme. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Yes this is it.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> So we need Investigation skill to track down its meaning, Lore skills to digest the text we do find, and Rapport skills to try picking the brains of those people who should know what they mean, if they weren't occupied or had forgotten them.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Someone must know something, but they aren't telling us. We should study the text. I think we are bothering them. üòñ
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Then this is what I see as the quest:
  <div></div><b>QUEST:</b> Dwarven Runes Quest
  <div></div><b>Location:</b> Currency Exchange Square and Elevator Shaft
  <div></div><b>Brief:</b> Spawn points at those locations are spawning monsters with Accel from the ancient dwarven runes, making them very difficult to defeat. The plan is to patch the runes so that their powers are not used by monsters.
  <div></div><b>Skills:</b> Investigation, Lore, Rapport
  <div></div><b>Boss:</b> Pick pocket, something that levitates.
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Zoey:</b> Maybe the dwarven runes aren't just ancient, they are a type of thieves' cant or are being used as thieves cant. We aren't going against a single boss monster, but <hl>two thieves guilds</hl>. That's why no body is talking.
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Then, what we see as monster spawn points are really distractions for the thief guilds to operate?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Great Aspects about the quest. üëç
  <msg spk="Sasha">Aspect is a FATE term.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I hope that it doesn't get too complicated. üòñ
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> But we know that their network runs deep. Those runes have ties to many store fronts.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I don't think they are all Thieves Cant. It could just be a common motif for decoration. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> But it could be.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Should Sylvia take this quest?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Phantom Thief vs Thief Guilds XD
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> What if she goes back...?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> üòñ
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's consider those ideas. Cardinal needs an upgrade to show stories per quest. This post will go toward that.
  <mbkudo><b>Tanya thanks all for the discussion.</b></mbkudo>

  <div class=""><b>June</b> is almost over, would it be have a small summary for each daily routine quest?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="" We use that for counting sets. It works much better than using numbers.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Won't miscount XD.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree will turn each item into a clickable thing to show details!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think quest open and close aren't really a thing. They should be part of Cardinal Quest.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Why are we combining all of them all of a sudden?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Doesn't that list look too long to you?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Not really, although a litte disorienting after seeing the new layout at Chapter 27.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Actually, what is the difference between the list of Daily Quests at HQ and at the calendar?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I like the one at the Calendar/sidebar because it shows what we are doing in the month.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>LRRH:</b> I think we want to keep the one per calendar so we can see changes over time. The one at HQ might be more general and overall, and may have an overall leaderboard. The one at calendar will reflect actual participants in that month.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> For the record, the study group finished reading about Silva at the beginning of the month, then had been readint FATE since. We finished reading FATE accelerated quite quickly, then moved to FATE core. We are about halfway in FATE core. So that will probably continue for half of July. And we are looking for something else to read.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Thank you for the summary!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Reading and lunch hour are basically the same activity.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> I think at Calendar we can combine them to reflect when we do it. At HQ they can be more distinct so that it is easier to see what the quest is by itself regardless how we combine them when we do it.
  <msg spk="LRRH">üëç</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> If we combine them, then we have morning, lunch, and the rest of the day: three sections?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I want to add a daily quest for tidying and important old content to the blog.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> About when would those activities be?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe night? They don't take a lot of thoughts, I think. But we should do some everyday.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> We should have some <ht>good trigger for the habit to stick.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> For tidying, how about when we leave or return to the guild house? And archiving will be triggered with importing field scores.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> For archiving, how about every time someone makes a post, they must archive something?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> That's a rather interesting idea.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> What about days when we don't post anything?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> If you would still archive something on those day, maybe you would end up posting something.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Little Red Riding Hood is slightly against Tanya's idea. If someone wants to discuss something, they should be able to just start a thread. You need to know a lot more on what's happening in the archive to be able to archive something.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe for those who do know how to archive can archive before posting?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Should StarTree do that? StarTree already makes the Status post everyday!
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think that should be exempted. On the daily log, StarTree would get 1 point for making the status post. Anyone else who wants a point can also get one by importing a post. We don't need two status posts, so that column only has StarTree right now.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> By if StarTree wants to import another post, she is not getting credits if it is just the same column.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> StarTree please add a column for Import. This will replace logging import activities in Guild Log.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> What if someone imports many posts in one sitting?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> How about if you import more than one thing in the same day, then use guild log for the extra? That shouldn't be very normal. Just trying to maintain that the task is not tied to anyone and it is optional. If you want to do it, there is a convenient way to log credits. But you don't need to do that to make a new post.
  <div></div><div class="". For PT, if you don't go, you can't do more just to make it up.
  <div></div><div class="" and import a lot at once. That's okay if that is more efficient. If someone wants to do that every day, the scoring should be easy. So it is a choice. If you want to do it, you may do it the way you want. The scoring at the end is the same. <hl>The scoring is not nudging you to favor either style.</hl>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Very compelling explanation.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Agreed.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Vivi:</b> StarTree, can you automatically tally the number of credits a person gets for that particular daily quest? If they do it once a day, it should be 30 for June.

  <msg spk="StarTree">There was an error in the Daily Quest Log where Fina's points were not counted correctly. It is fixed now!</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> The daily quests section looks really nice! üòç
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Ledia's six star PT score XD
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> For July, could we have a clerical daily quest group? Maybe it could combine with News Watch session?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> The group will include News Watch, Importing, Tally, and Tidying? They are approximately in the same time slot!
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Yes please.
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Does it include all chores except cooking? Because cooking and lunch reading are a different group!
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Yes. ?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> That group will have 20 columns, should some columns be combined?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> What was highest score in that combined group last month?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> It is 42 points!
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I would say group that with Reading &amp; Lunch also.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Umm... What is the point if you group all of them together? We can't tell what the routine is XD
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> If you want to highlight a group, you could use the space on the side.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> True, but that doesn't answer my question. Why do you want to group them all together?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Vivi:</b> The PT and Cardinal groups are dominate groups, the rest is miscelleneous. I want to see a few big groups instead of many small groups.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Hmm... I'll wait to see the result.
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> With that group of 26 columns, the highest score is 70!
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Are all columns accounted in Daily Log?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> The five columns we report daily are not accounted: Participation, Merit, Recognition, Kudos, Arcacia Award!
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> How much is that worth combined?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> The highest score is 127, of which 84 came from Arcacia Award!
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Could you set those four groups with June data in the July Calendar so we can compare?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Roger!

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> It is done!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> What do others think? I think this is more meaningful and should replace the June.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> The most important thing for me is that those starts should add up to the per day average for each member.
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> It would not do that yet because it doesn't count the points logged at Guild Log!
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> And how much would that worth? Try adding that to Baker's Dozen group.
  <mbkudo><b>StarTree thanks Vivi for making life really interesting!</b></mbkudo>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> <hl>StarTree is the most cheerful because StarTree is the more Tree~ful! XD</hl>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Wee~~!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> In that category, the highest score is 110. Combining that with Baker's Dozen gives a highest score of: 140.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Perfect. Please update the list.
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> And it is done! Now the stars should add up to the one shown in Leaderboard!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Does anyone want to say something for Cardinal Quest and Discussion? They look a little blank üòÖ
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> For Arsenal, we are losing control if we don't catch up.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Tanya please put something to carry us forward. üôè

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>Based</b> on comments yesterday, I added a function FlexShow in the javascript. There are some added effects that I want people to try. I think it is better if the behavior is consistent across the blog.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> <b>Effect 1: </b> Objects in a flex container are normally split into three columns as shown on desktop. The width is enough to show a card. On mobile, those objects will show in one column.
  <div></div><b>Effect 2:</b> When it is clicked, on desktop it will move up above the separate columns and <hl>expand to full width</hl>. This is the main feature that makes it functional on desktop. On mobile, the content will just show in-place.
  <div></div><b>Effect 3:</b> By our convention, if a 100 pixel square thumbnail exists, it will shrink to 50 pixel square when the content is expanded. When the content is collapsed again, the thumbnail will not restore to 100 pixel. This is intentional to show that the content has been visited.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> You may try it at <button class="">Ch 25</button>.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> This is very nice, thank you.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> For the Guide section, could you add an avatar to the content once expanded? I want to know who is speaking.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I added 100px for step 1, 50px for step 2, and kept step 3 to have none for comparison.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> 100px.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Black, are you going to import the story?
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> When I get around to it next time.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I want to see how you would format it.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Your guide section is too nested. The steps shouldn't be in another cheesboard.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I am planning to merge Problems and Failures to the same tab and see how that goes.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> I'll wait.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Can Chapter 22 get some love and get this formatting for story posts?
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I don't imagine it to be any different.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> But for stories, the actual content is in the Archive. Then the user needs to click it twice?
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I think in that case you would want to write a synopsis. So at the uppermost level, that would be the Quest. The reader clicks on that and it expands and shows the Quest synopsis. If they want to read the story, then then click on the Query link to load the links.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Right now at <button class="">CH 22</button>, the synopsis is already part of the upper button. The viewer clicks once to load the query list, then click again to view the post.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> Black, I think they are asking for a function that does what your function did, but also queries a list and list them inside while expanding at the same time.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I can kind of see that, but I feel I am OOM.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Then I'll do it. If you don't mind, I might just modify your FlexShow function so that it will also run a query if it exists in the structure. Then we don't have to remember what function is for what. They are all the same one function, it does everything depending what is around it.
  <mbaa>Ivy receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> It's all yours. üëç
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> My plan is to store a query string in the same button that the viewer clicks. Then the function will load the content to the last div inside the sibling. If someone who has stories to post wants to vet it first.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> So you are asking whether Querying is the last thing of the expanded content.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Essentially yes.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> That seems to be the convention so far. But I think we are missing the previous and next buttons. After reading a section of the story, the viewer can't continue to the next segment.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> How about I try to make it so that the function scans the content of the sibling and looks for a tag with a command to query. For each one it sees, it does the query and replace the tag with the queried content?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think that is what we need.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Is this difficult?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> It shouldn't be too difficult. I'll start now.

  <div class=""><b>In</b> Stewardism, there is a concept of open access to basic needs. This means that people have a right to reasonable share of natural resources, and do not have a right to destroy resources that are needed by others. 
  <div></div><b>Arena:</b> On the other hand democratic socialism has the concept of Universal basic Income. Open Access and UBI are not the same. Or are they? Who wants to come duke it out?
  <msg spk="Zoey">Fina's got to fight XD</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I'm interested in this discussion but I am speaking from some one exploring Arcacianism, not socialism.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Fina, what is your challenge question?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Universal Access: Yes or no? What does your philosophy have about people trying to make their own living?
  <div></div><div class="" is ambiguous. It can mean too many things for people to attack by misinterpretation.
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> In Stewardism, there are private properties and public properties. Public properties are numerous and watched over under stewardship principles. Whether something can be a piece of personal property is a matter of abundance and necessity. Things that are necessary fall under open access stewardship. It means that you may use what you need. You may not harm the sustainability. If you keep others away from fair sharing, you lose your right to access that resource.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> This might not be entirely related to what Fina wants to discuss here, but I want to reply to someone taking about UBI .
  <msg spk="LRRH">Summary of that thread. The OP said UBI and automationa are not compatible because the more high-tech jobs become, the more complicated new jobs there will be for people to work on.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Then I replied that UBI and automation are compatible within the context of distributing basic things the automation can afford.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Then a third person says nothing is automatic and that is utopia.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">They are using some kind of logical fallacies... Although that is off topic.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Fina, what do you want to discuss?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Let's reply first. This has nothing to do with Arena, but let's see how has the best reply.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think the third tweeter is worried about inflation. If basic necessities are sufficiently and affordably produced by automation, then they would be free. You wouldn't need to pay people UBI for them to extra for what they need and is automated and affordable, but also things that are not automated and in scarcity.
  <msg spk="LRRH">That reply would be too long for Twitter.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Sorry. üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Is length all the matters? How do we want to judge what reply is the best? What effect should it have?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> We can use the same scale where Celebrative reply has 5 points.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is pretty hard to be celebrative without sounding sarcastic üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> How does UBI prevent people from not doing their own fair share?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> It does not. You are allowed to slack off. You don't need to do anything for things that are free.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> For example, sunlight is free. You may get as much sun tan or sunburn as you want.

  <div class=""><b>World</b> Tree is formally commissioning heroes assistance in crafting the magical directory, dubbed the <i>Book of Life</i> to assist the World Tree Root Quest to survey the realm.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> This is Zoey the Ranger from World Tree Quest Center. For the quest charter, please go to World Tree Quest Center and look for Quest Charter ID 202207041052 in the Root Quests section.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I like where this is going, Chapter 13 is looking really nice! üòä</msg>

  <msg spk="Tanya">What about the Albatross?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I feel like building a directory here because everyone is here and I want to be useful and part of the story.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> The Albatross is still being built and maintained as a Leaf Quest. It is concurrent to all other quests.
  <msg spk="Zoey">By the way, I already added a JQuery tag at the "Quest Card" to link to any thread tagged with <i>[data-quest-202207041052]</i>, and tagged this thread with it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Sasha stealthily watches the quest center.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Arx Dungeon is dungeon crawl, Arena is PvP, what kind of quests are those here?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It can be a mix of any kind. The Book of Life quest would appear to be a crafting quest, but if you say you need a key ingredient from a dungeon then it becomes a dungeon quest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I think it is better if it sticks to a theme so we know what to expect. How about a familiar raising theme? No where else can have that theme to the fullness.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Pokemon XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't understand üòÖ I hope it is not too complicated.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey the Ranger greets Evelyn. "The roots of the World Tree reaches many realms through portals where you could reach many powerful things. But the quest itself is only asking for anything that would work until it is upgraded further.
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">What is the real life thing that we are collecting in the directory?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It is concepts. @Seed is taking over @Concept to list all the concepts.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Arcacianism already has a mascot. So if you want to define Arcacianism, in RP you could be describing the Arcacian Princess Squirrel.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">That doesn't sound too bad üòÉ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Not everything has to be a creature. It can be a plant, a material, a location, etc.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Just a comment on how to translate real life situation into roleplay: After identifying the challenge in real life, you could define a challenge in the game with analogus aspects.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Evelyn cleared an area at the quest board so people may pin their findings similar to how the quest board currently works. She knows this is probably not what people ultimately want, but she believes that more ideas will come when people start using it.
  <mbcomplete>Evelyn has started making Book of Life.</mbcomplete>
  <mbrec>Evelyn earns the recognition "The first step is the hardest."</mbrec>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">For the ID, does it really matter what it is? The quest object has an ID "data-quest-yyyy-mmdd-hhmm". Do the other objects also need to be categorized? Would they need an ID like "data-xxxx-yyyy-mmdd-hhmm"?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think having no category is better. That can be an additional tag.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Okay. I am convinced that we don't need "quest" in the ID. If we do that, it would only make sense if we put Quests and all other things in the same directory. and <i>data-quest</i> is a tag for querying.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Will the content be RP or non-RP?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think RP. But you could use bubbles for non-RP information.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <msg spk="Ivy">I am referring to the 
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I see many good features, like the scrollable sidebar on the left with expanable categories, the fixed section header on the right, and a search box on top.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">On the upper left there is a breadcrumb path that show how you could browse to the article from the root.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Oh wow. I feel that we need this, for magic bakery.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Sasha:</b> Sasha shows up and brings another <hl>tome</hl> for inspiration.
  <msg spk="Sasha">What about the Pokemon 
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I hope we have enough pictures. üòÑ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The non-RP content is the most important for me. It should have concise definition if we will show it to someone.</msg>

  <msg spk="Sasha">Sasha to Tanya: The page is seriously lacking pictures and colors. I propose that instead of doing the dungeon, we upgrade it first.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey arrives at the dungeon and sees Sasha at the check-in, there went the theory that they saw a doppelganger.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Why didn't you keep the mystery going? XD</msg>

  <msg spk="Tanya">What do we want to do? Go for another story session or just update the page?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <msg spk="Tanya">It has been 10 days since the last time we had a dungeon session. I'll leave it to the group to decide.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Evelyn:</b> I heard that for us to complete the training, we need to gather enough points from the dungeon. There is no sign anywhere about this. Is it official? Should we keep track of how many points we have and how many points we need?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Yes, we should have a sign about that.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I am playing solo as a mage. I need 30,000 points total. I have 2,250 points so far. So I'm going to put myself on a scoreboard.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> It looks really nice! üòç
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> The bar is so long for Sasha XD
  <div></div><div class="" Ledia arrives at the dungeon.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Should we all put our scores on it, too?
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The heroes put their scores on a chart at the reception area. The bland entrance now has some color and was filled with happiness.
  <mbmerit>Tanya awards merits to Evelyn and Sasha.</mbmerit>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe we should make it a habit that every time we come we make something a little better?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Yes I agree. maybe that should be like the "entrance fee".
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think if it is not mandatory, people tend to do something better because when they do, they do it out of the joy of doing it.
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Should we start or should we call it a day? I heard that if you get KO'ed in the dungeon, you could lose ALL of your points.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Is that official? üòÖ
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I am letting Sasha adjust the rules for training purposes.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> For training purposes, let's keep the rule where if you are KO'ed, including getting warped back from exhaustion, then you lose one item of your choice.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Then I am opening a chamber since I don't have an item to lose yet.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Um... but then what is the point of entering...?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Right. üê£
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Can we start in the morning or in the weekend then? I don't want to get KO'ed. It's already 11 PM. XD
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I second that.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, could you schedule an event for this weekend?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Roger!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> As the heroes discuss the plan to regroup in the weekend, Sasha nukes a pudding near Ledia that had leaked through the door that LRRH was half opening.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Even if you can lose an item by getting KO'ed, there is still a point in entering because you could get more than one item before you are KO'ed, or you could get an item of more points before you get KO'ed. Ledia and Red were both guilty of Slippery Slope.</msg>
  <mbdmg>Sasha vaporizes the small group of puddings. Ledia and LRRH lose 1 hit point each. LRRH is KO'ed.</mbdmg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ</msg>

          2023-06: The TSN is implemented in OneNote, but so far it seems harder to use than the Word version. OneNote allows searching separated words, but the way it displays search result seems worse than Word. It is difficult to cycle through each match, perhaps the searcher needs to rethink how to use OneNote search to take advantage of the fact that it can match separated words.

  <div></div><b>Black:</b> This thread itself is about the format of a "Quest Card". If we have a standard format, then we can do less each time defining a quest.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> I think the purpose of separating data from its presentation code is to make it <i>EASIER</i> to change the presentation as we like. So the order you described is the opposite. What we could do instead, is to start defining new tags. It is up to the formatter on how to format and display that quest data. Potentially there can be multiple formatters. Either the chapter or the viewer can select the formatter.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> This would solve a very important problem that I face. Sometimes I want to see a quest in RP format, sometimes I want to see it in non-RP format. If there are two formatters, then I can switch between RP and non-RP.
  <msg spk="Ivy">Correct.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> It is not clear to me what initiates the translation.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Maybe we need to create or upgrade a more general object viewer. The function of the object viewer is that you feed it an ID, then it fetches the data and represents it. You can then click on different format types and it will format the display accordingly.

  <msg spk="Mikela">Yes please!</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button> <hide><b>Ivy:</b> I just jump out of the blender. Very roughly speaking, every creature that can jump can jump about the same height regardless their size. If you can jump out of a blender before being shrunk, then you can jump out of it while shrunk. This is a science puzzle.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Mikela:</b> Congratulations! We have a winner!

  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> You can still try if you haven't read my answer.

  <mbrec>3B is now recognized for the Alchemist skill Metal Bend.</mbrec>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> So is this a science puzzle? Since Ivy got it right away.
  <div></div><b>Mikela:</b> That is up to you!

  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So is Ledia inside the blender also? Can Ledia break us out?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Actually who are in the blender?

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> That's too evil. Us talking will take 1 minute already, and I can't nuke all of the cords in 1 minute.
  <mbkudo><b>Evelyn thanks Sasha for the kind thoughts.</b></mbkudo>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> If I just Tiamat out I should be able to cut at least a few cords.If they all line up I could probably cut all of them in Accel.
  <mbspell>Ledia Tiamats out of her blender and cuts all cords with Accel, just in time before the first blender would start.</mbspell>

  <mbdmg>Natalie went looking for a rope but there was no rope to be found, and realized that a rope which she could carry back would really be a string instead.</mbdmg>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Mikela:</b> The official answer is that E=mgh. The height a rocket can reach is its energy divided by its mass and gravity.

  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I imagine that Ivy got out of the blender while no one noticed and just watched our drama! XD

      This book primiarily discusses solutions to issues that arise in an authoritarian command structure. Quest Society employs a flat command structure. Therefore, you may find some of the concepts contradicting to Magic Bakery values.
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Lessons - Part I: Winning the war within</h4>
      ‚≠ê <b>Extreme Ownership</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide> On any team, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader. The leader must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.</hide><div></div>
      
      ‚≠ê <b>No Bad Teams Only Bad Leaders</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide> If substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable, that poor performance becomes the new standard. When it comes to standards, as a leader, it's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate. Consequencees for failing need not be immediately severe, but leaders must ensure that tasks are repeated until the higher expected standard is achieved in a way that encourages and enables the team to utilize Extreme Ownership. </hide><div></div>
      ‚≠ê <b>Believe</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide> To convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish a mission, a leader must be a true believer in the mission. If a leader does not believe, they will not take the risks required to overcome the inevitable challenges necessary to win. Leader must always operate with the understanding that they are part of something greater than themselves and their own personal interests. If they cannot determina a satisfactory answer themselves, they must ask questions up the chain of command until they understand why. </hide><div></div>
      ‚≠ê <b>Check the Ego</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide>Implementing Extreme Ownership requires checking your ego and operating with a high degree of humility. Wanting to win and be the best is good, but when ego becomes destructive when it clouds our judgment and prevents us from seeing the world as it is. We can't ever think we are too good to fail or that our enemies are not capable, deadly, and eager to exploit our weaknesses.</hide><div></div>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Lessons - Part II: Laws of Combat</h4>
      ‚≠ê <b>Cover and Move</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide>Team members must always help each other, work together, and support each other to win. </hide><div></div>
      ‚≠ê <b>Simple</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide>Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success. As a leader, it doesn't matter how well you feel you have presented the information or communicated an order, plan, tactic, or strategy. If your team doesn't get it, you have not kept things simple and you have failed. </hide><div></div>
      ‚≠ê <b>Prioritize and Execute</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide>Relax, look around, make a call. A leader must remain calm and determine the highest priority task and execute. A particularly effective means to help Prioritize and Execute under pressure is to stay at least a step or two ahead of real-time problems. Don't let the focus on one priority cause target fixation. Maintain the ability to see other problems developing and rapidly shift as needed. </hide><div></div>
      ‚≠ê <b>Decentralized Command</b> 
      <button class="" This allows Junior leaders to be proactive rather than reactive. </hide>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Lessons - Part III: Sustaining Victory</h4>
      ‚≠ê <b>Plan</b> 
      <button class="" of the oepration. By maintaining a perspective above the microterrain of the plan, senior leaders can better ensure compliance with strategic objectives and be the tactical genius identifying weaknesses or holes in the plan. The planning process and briefing must be a forum that encourages discussion, questions, and clarification from even the most junior personnel. Time is made for a post-operational debrief that examines all phases of an operation from planning through execution, in a concise format. What went right? What went wrong? How can we adapt and be more effective?
      <div class="">
        <h4>A leader's checklist for planning</h4>
        <b> Analyze the mission:</b> Understand mission intent and endstate<br>
        <b>Identify personnel, assets, resources, and time available.</b><br>
        <b>Decentralize the planning process:</b> Empower key leaders within the team to analyze possible courses of action<br>
        <b>Determin specific course of action:</b> Lean toward the simplest course of action; focus effort on the best course of action.<br>
        <b>Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action.</b><br>
        <b>Mitigate risks that can be controlled as much as possible.</b><br>
        <b>Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders</b><br>
        <b>Continually check and question the plan against emerging information to ensure it still fits the situation.</b><br>
        <b>Brief the plan to all participants and supporting assets</b><br>
        <b>Conduct post-operational debrief after execution.</b><br>
      </div>
      </hide><div></div>
      ‚≠ê <b>Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide>Leaders must routinely communicate with their team members to help them understand their role in the overall mission, and push situational awareness up the chain of command. Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world, subordinates and superiors alike. If someone isn't doing what you want or need them to do, look in the mirror first and determine what you can do to better enable this. Don't ask your leader what you should do, tell them what you are going to do.</hide><div></div>
      ‚≠ê <b>Decisiveness Amid Uncertainty</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide>There is no 100 percent right solution. The picture is never complete. Leaders must be comfortable with this and be able to make decisions promptly, then be ready to adjust those decisions quickly based on evolving situations and new information.</hide><div></div>
      ‚≠ê <b>Discipline Equals Freedom</b> 
      <button class="">...</button><hide>Generally, when a leader struggles, the root cause behind the problem is that the leader has leaned too far in one direction and steered off course. Awareness of the dichotomies in leadership allows this discovery and enables the correction.
        <div class="">
          <h4>The Dichotomy of Leadership</h4>
          A good leader must be:<br>
          Confident but not cocky; Courageous but not foolhardy; Competitive but a gracious loser; Attentive to details but not obsessed by them; Strong but have endurance; A leader and follower; Humble not passive; Aggressive not overbearing; Quiet not silent; Calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions; Close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge; Able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command.<br>
          <i>A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove.</i>

  <div class=""><b>We</b> got this book <i>Extreme Ownership: How US Navy Seals Lead and Win</i> for the reading club. I don't think we can read it during lunch. So this might be a weekend activity and I will try to summarize relevant lessons somewhere.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I don't think this is a military book but a leadership book.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I'm interested. And I think we should upgrade Chapter 26 to house reading club study notes.

  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I take that back. Let's put study notes at Page \ Data, and link to it wherever we want. But I think Chapter 26 should have a link to that data so we know what books we have regardless whether there are study notes about them.
  <msg spk="Black">Okay. What should the ID be in Data section?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Let's use the same ID code format as posts. Which is "P" followed by 12 digits timestamp.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I'm also interested. For my understanding, why do we need the P code ID?

  <msg spk="Tanya">I am asking why do you need <code>ID="P############"</code> when you could have fetched the same item by using <code>data-P############</code>?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">It is true that you can get it either way.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But there is an advantage of using data, because <code>&lt;jq&gt;</code> tag alreadys works if you use data.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That might be the way going forward, if we put the content in Archive also.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> Let's visualize it a little bit. So we are saying that we will create a div in Archive without an ID, because @Book can fetch everything with the tag data-book without knowing what it is. But if we need to edit the content, we need to go to Archive and locate that. How do we do that?
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. I am convinced that we need the ID. The ID is for us to locate it in the Archive, and for the Viewer to show the content.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Yes. I forgot about the viewer. This means we don't need to make another viewer for quest objects either.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> Let's confirm with some basic tests before going any further.
  <msg spk="Black">I added P202207101451. How is it? Do we want it to show on Calendar also?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">It looks fine showing on Calendar. Maybe all posts should look like this actually.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The viewer does not automatically expand and show the content.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">We can fix that later.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The tone of this book is quite different from Arcacian principles. Maybe we should make a comparison on how a similar principle would be expressed in Arcacianism.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> For instance, the concept on page 238 would violate Arcacianism. It reads, "But at the end of the day, once the debate on a particular course of action is over and the boss has made a decision--even if that decision is one you argued against-- you must execute the plan as if it were your own."
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In Arcacianism, there aren't mandatory leadership. If you don't agree with a plan, then don't join the team. Some of the presented principles are about an authoritarian structure, but Arcacian structure is flat.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In a Quest society, a person would join a quest only if they agree with its purpose. That voluntary dynamic bypasses many of the issues the principles in Extreme Ownership try to address.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In other words, Extreme Ownership is teaching people how to fix a systemic problem (caused by an authoritarian structure) through people, instead of solving it at the system level. Quest Society is a system level solution to those problems.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> I somewhat agree. Should we stop or finish reviewing all the principles?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's finish the principles since we are already on 11 out of 12 principles. But we should add a disclaimer that this book deals with issues that arise in an authoritarian structure, which is not really relevant to Arcancianism that uses Quest structure. In Arcacianism, "Leadership" means something else and requires different skills.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I will pin your comment. Let's finish it.
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [7:36 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> So we finished reading all the principles. That means that we skipped everything about military operations. Those interested can find the book at the guild bookshelves.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Should there be a follow up quest about this book?
  <div></div><div class="" is a given in Arcacianism because quests are voluntary. By design there is no one to blame. The dichotomy of leadership described in its last chapter are basic virtues that everyone should strive to have regardless whether they are leading someone or following someone. Those qualities are what make a leader in Arcacianism popular.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I disagree with the last part of your comment. In Arcacianism, a leader can be popular just because they have a lot of rewards to give. You can totally bribe people to become their favorite.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> You are right.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> In terms of follow up quests, I think we have way too many unread books to focus on this one, and even more non-book quests to focus on reading. I think what we need is to start creating an inventory of the books we have, so we can <b>Prioritize and Execute</b>. Being true to our Quest Society structure, and having no leader telling us what to do, I propose updating Chapter 26 @Book to have a quest that includes a routine that inventory books we have, prioritize a book that can help us the most, and read and procedue a summary like the one we did.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I see Ivy is communicating the intent of the quest quite clearly.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In Quest Society, if your quest is clear and simple then people can understand and do it. The Quest Giver doesn't take all the credits because each Quest Taker gets their own credits. The person that ends up having the most credits is not necessarily the Quest Giver. I feel that principle that <i>Extreme Ownership</i> mentioned are built-in to Quest Society. In a Quest Society, you don't need to be taught how to be a leader. the Quest System drives a person to take responsibility of their actions.
  <msg spk="Ivy">Tanya, I think we understand that. You are just repeating yourself now.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I'm sorry.</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">It's a fighter game XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I can kind of see that. Is there hit point? What should hit point represent?
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> I think hit point will correspond to followers. But I don't want to answer everything. I think you can figure it out.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> But if you know it already it will save us time doing something you don't want. XD
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> Then let's just say I don't know anything more. But if I see something I don't like I can tell you.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think that is very generous of Fina to help us, we will do our best and figure it out! üôè
  <div></div><b>Fina:</b> I put Arcacia as a Champion. If you also want to fight for Arcacianims, you could add yourself as a separate Champion, even if you are fighting for the same philosophy.

  <msg spk="Ledia">Okay. Then I'll just put some notes so I don't forget. I think we need a way to translate popularity into hit points. Maybe we can think about that until we discuss.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think gamification will be easier once we gathered all the statistics and facts. So we should just fill out the profiles with facts and definitions. Gamification comes after that. Skipping the facts will make it very difficult.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I agree with Tanya. Gathering facts and definitions is easier. We already have some at Seed of Peace. I will do what I know first, especially when I agree that that is the first step XD.

      <div class="">üçÄ How to make a term more searchable</div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        The key to making a term more searchable on Google is to provide high-quality, relevant content that is well-organized and easy for search engines to understand.<br>

        <div class="">1Ô∏è‚É£ Use relevant keywords</div>
        <hide>
          Make sure to use relevant keywords in your content. Think about the words and phrases that people would use to search for the topic you are writing about and incorporate them into your content.
        </hide>
        <div class="">2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize your title and meta description</div>
        <hide>
          The title and meta description of your content are what appear in search results. Make sure they accurately reflect the content of your page and include relevant keywords.
        </hide>
        <div class="">3Ô∏è‚É£ Use header tags</div>
        <hide>
          Use header tags (H1, H2, H3) in your content to organize it and make it easier for Google to understand what your page is about.
        </hide>
        <div class="">4Ô∏è‚É£ Link to other relevant content</div>
        <hide>
          Linking to other relevant content on your website or other reputable websites can help Google understand the context of your content.

        <div class="">5Ô∏è‚É£ Use alt tags for images</div>
        <hide>
          Use alt tags for images: Alt tags provide descriptions of images on your website. Using descriptive alt tags can help Google understand the content of your page.
        </hide>
        <div class="">6Ô∏è‚É£ Use schema markup</div>
        <hide>

  Fort Arsenal Jewel Market</small></center><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>At</b> Fort Arsenal, the heroes are in the middle of questing while waiting for the market to clear for investigation...
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Sasha:</b> If we are just waiting, could we talk about something else? I want to get Mice &amp; Mystics. It is really cute and it is on sale.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think we have too many board games.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> But this is VERY cute and it has 6 player characters, just like us.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Cute!! üòç</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> The review says there is a lot of reading and the gameplay is just meh.
  <msg spk="Sasha">We don't have to follow its rules.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Would you rather spend a lot of time playing that game, or spend the same amount of time playing our guild quest?
  <msg spk="Sasha">‚Ä¶</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I would consider it progress if Sasha hesitates XD
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I thought we went through that with Adventure Begins. If it doesn't lead to some EXP I feel empty doing it.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> But it is really cute. And if we have time reading FATE, then we have time reading its story/manual.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Game Manual reading club! That's the first! XD
  <msg spk="Tanya">I say we shelf this discussion because yes we are waiting, but there are also things we can do. Let's switch to the Levitator.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes, commander.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Sasha WISHES **@LRRH** that the guild would get Mice &amp; Mystics and play it in a way that is fulfilling and rewarding.
  <mbspell>Sasha makes a WISH.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That's cheating! XD</msg>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [4:44 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> What do we feel like doing? Now that the market is in session again?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> We planned to look into Deer Crossing tomorrow. Maybe we should help on the Guardian quest?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think we need another page for Cardinal Quest quests. Because Chapter 30 proper is about the rule set, not our quests.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think they can just be in the same chapter.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I also lean toward them being in the same chapter. Why do you think that they should be separate?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">It is just an idea. Please don't think too much about it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I think we are moving toward having personal dashboards. Each member can maintain their own page and pin whatever they want to show using jquery tags.
  <msg spk="Ledia">That's true.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">If we configure our own dashboard then we can visit each other's dash board. üòä</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Monster sighted. Dispatching now.
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> In the last couple days the power of the board increased a lot after implementing a quest template. Now the board is much closer to the original vision a year ago when Chapter 13 was created. I think we need a centralized quest board. There you will be able to filter quests as you like. I think I should start listing the features to work toward.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I can hardly keep up with the last few days! XD
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Take a long exhale. It is better than taking a deep breath for calming down.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Thanks for the advice XD
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I believe the next major step for the guild is to transplant our content to github so we can make use of databases.
  <msg spk="Zoey">OMG XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I thought I would just give you a heads up so you would be more mentally prepared.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Should I stop importing old posts to blogger? üòñ
  <msg spk="Ivy">My transition plan is that we try to consolidate and restructure everything in Blogger as closely as what we would need for an HTML website built from scratch, then the transition might be just as easy as copying over a few files.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> What is the purpose of transitioning?
  <msg spk="Ivy">To implement a quest society system we need a way to tally points. That means that we need a platform where a user can post quests through the interface instead of editting HTML as an admin. The user shouldn't need to know how to code to post and do quests and get credits. The platform should also need to tally the score and display it. Blogger lacks access to a database for that kind of interaction.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I kind of like how we can have different pages. If we switch to the new one will they all look like standard forms?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">No it won't. You can customize it however you want. But the database is there to store the data for you.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Then I don't see any down side since we already aren't using any Blogger features. We are already coding in HTML. In terms of difficulty it seems it will only become easier.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That's my assessment. AFTER we lay down the ground work and have a working database.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Imagine this. Say I have an idea for a new quest while chatting, just like now. So I open a side panel, browse to a quest that is relevant to peacemaking, and click on a [+] button to add a new quest. And Voila. If I want to mention that in a chat, I can drag that quest and drop it in chat.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I agree that is the best. I hope I can still help making it‚Ä¶ üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> We need a list of features so we can easily ask others what platform would be the best for this. WordPress might be a good choice‚Ä¶
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think our priority right now should be @Arena because it is very central to what we need to do as a guild. I wouldn't mind if our actual quest handling system lags behind, because the technicality is never a question. We know there is no technical hurdle, it is all in advertising the idea so others may want to have such system.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I agree with Zoey's priority.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I'm not trying to convince anyone to change their priority. I am just forecasting what is next so when we upgrade blogger we are making changes in that direction.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I am fine as long as we are not shutting down Blogger tomorrow and have to build another site from scratch to catch up to where we are before we can see the @Arena fights XD

      <div class=""><b>The</b> purpose of this quest is to define the focus of Chapter 28 @Freedom, aka the Freedom Plaza. My overall vision is to establish Freedom Plaza as a main gateway from the outside world to our guild without Roleplaying to maintain the highest clarity. ~20220714</div>
      
      <div class="">
        <h4>Version Up (20220714)</h4>
        With @Concept changing to @Dungeon as a training ground, many items, most news events, previously logged there were recategorized to @Freedom. @Freedom decides to take charge of presenting those news events and take the unique role in the guild as a news hub. As such, housekeeping quests are now at odds with that focus. Those quests are up for adoption by @Guild or @Board, or @Treasure.

                <small><b>Note 2:</b></small> Cheeses are the cost of using abilities. The heroes can randomly get cheese when they roll dice.

                  In our group, we decided that after casting the transformation spell that Maginos could not cast without borrowing Vanestra's power, it would make sense if Maginos is out-of-mana. Therefore we have him be the odd one out.

                <h4>TLDR</h4> The heroes quickly retrieved their equipment in custody before the transformation spell ended, but Vanestra discovered their escape and transformed the prison guards into Rat Warriors to chase them.

                        The player with a hero lowest on the turn order control the movement of the Rat Warriors. However, each Rat Warrior must move to a hero closes to it. If there is a tie between two heroes, the Rat Warrior will attack the hero higher on the turn order. After moving as need toward its target hero, the Rat Warrior will attack if its target hero is in an adjacent or same space.

                        Roll two dice for the Rat Warrior (since its Battle Value is 2), and count the swords. Roll the number of dice equal to the Defense value of the hero (plus any bonus from armor), and count the shields. Each shield cancels a sword of the Rat Warrior. The hero takes a wound for each sword not cancelled.

                        Rat Warrior rolling cheese has no effect. But if a hero rolls cheese while defending, the game clock advances 10 minutes once immediately, and the hero gets one cheese for each cheese they rolled.

                        <h4>Bow </h4>
                        The bow symbol rolled by a Rat Warrrior or a hero doesn't have any effect in this case.

      <h4>Principles (and comparisons)</h4>
      <i>See 
      <b>1</b> That my being partakes of your being and that of all beings. This goes beyond interdependency‚Äîour very existence is relational. That, therefore, what we do to another, we do to ourselves. 
      <msg spk="Tanya">This is not a principle in Arcacianism. Arcacianism cares about beings that are not part of ourselves.</msg>
      <div></div>
      <b>2</b> That each of us has a unique and necessary gift to give the world.
      <msg spk="Tanya">Arcacianism does not prescribe necessity nor uniqueness. It is about helping, not looking for something special about yourself (although you could very well find it while helping others.</msg>
      <div></div>
      <b>3</b> That the purpose of life is to express our gifts.
      <msg spk="Tanya">Arcacianism does not prescribe a purpose of life. Gifting is a choose. A person may choose to adopt that as their purpose of life.</msg>
      <div></div>
      <b>4</b> That every act is significant and has an effect on the cosmos.
      <msg spk="Tanya">Arcacianism does not prescribe such importance to <i>every act</i>. Arcacianism recognizes that small acts can build habits.</msg>
      <div></div>
      <b>5</b> That we are fundamentally unseparate from each other, from all beings, and from the universe.
      <msg spk="Tanya">Similar to principle 1, the truthfulness of this condition is irrelevant.</msg>
      <div></div>
      <b>6</b> That every person we encounter and every experience we have mirrors something in ourselves.
      <msg spk="Tanya">In Arcacianism, a person can find new paths and experience. It is more about accepting new encounters</msg>
      <div></div>
      <b>7</b> That humanity is meant to join fully the tribe of all life on Earth, offering our uniquely human gifts toward the well-being and development of the whole.
      <msg spk="Tanya">Similar to principle 3, there is no prescribed meaning in Arcacianism. You don't have to live a life aiming to offer something unique to others. You could just enjoy or share the good things you encountered.</msg>
      <div></div>
      <b>8</b> That purpose, consciousness, and intelligence are innate properties of matter and the universe.
      <msg spk="Tanya">Arcacianism prescribes neither of the three.</msg>
    </div>

      <h4>Chapter 32 - Miracle</h4>
      <div class=""></div>
      ‚≠ê When one is aligned with the purpose of service, acts that seem exceptionally courageous to others are a matter of course.<br>
      ‚≠ê When one experiences the world as abundant, then acts of generosity are natural, since there is no doubt about continued supply.<br>
      ‚≠ê When one sees other people as reflections of oneself, forgiveness becomes second nature, as one realizes ‚ÄúBut for the grace of God, so go I.‚Äù<br>
      ‚≠ê When one appreciates the order, beauty, mystery, and connectedness of the universe, a deep joy and cheerfulness arises that nothing can shake.<br>
      ‚≠ê When one sees time as abundant and life as infinite, one develops superhuman patience.<br>
      ‚≠ê When one lets go of the limitations of reductionism, objectivity, and determinism, technologies become possible that the science of separation cannot countenance.<br>
      ‚≠ê When one lets go of the story of the discrete and separate self, amazing intuitive and perceptual capabilities emerge from lifelong latency.<br>

  <div class=""><b>Mice</b> &amp; Mystics Chapter 1 Go Go Go!
  <msg spk="Zoey">Friday Night Game Session XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I'm following Tanya's format of using CHAT for RP and BUBBLE for non-RP. Starting now.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">For this playthrough, I want to use the official game rules first, until we decide that we have something better and we won't miss some surprising mechanics or plot that the designer planned.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">So who is reading the story?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">We take turn reading it? It is not that long.</msg>
  <lnk>202207142259|üßÄ Mice &amp; Mystics</lnk>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I can't believe that there IS an explanation to why the mice have armor! XD
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Are we RPing?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">After reading the prologue and start of chapter one, I have no idea how to RP. Let's just talk normal for now and play the game.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">To summarize, we were planning to revoke against Vanestra the evil queen. We were caught and thrown into a dungeon. To escape, we permanently transformed ourselves into mice, but Vanestra found that out also and transformed some guards into mice to chase us.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Our immediate objective for Chapter One is to escape to the courtyard before time runs out. We will need to defeat all enemies at the last tile and reach the exit space before time runs out.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It says Lily the Archer is not in Chapter One! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I guess I'll GM this time! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">We still have one extra.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I'll sit out and co-GM.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">But you are Collin, if you don't play, wouldn't that make the game really hard?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think that makes the first Chapter a good chapter to sit out.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I guess.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) So I will use the CHAT to talk about game. We are about to start Chapter 1. The players we have are Sasha (Maginos), Evelyn (Tilda), Casey (Nez), and P4 (Filch).
  <msg spk="Tanya">I have an idea. I should sit out as Maginos. He was the mage who had just transformed everyone into mice, which was supposed to be a huge feat. He should be out of mana.</msg>
  <mbaa>Tanya  receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That does make a lot of sense. Then, I play Collin? ü§î</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think P4 should play Collin. You should play Filch. From the story, you are more like Filch. It might be easier to RP.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I don't feel strongly either way.</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">If I play Collin could we swap stats and class?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's way too confusing. I'll play Collin. Let's try first. If it doesn't work, we can change it next time.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) Players, after choosing your mouse, you may look at all the ability cards and choose one. Please consider the abilities your mouse already has when you choose.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Does it mean that Tilda as a healer can't heal anyone without getting First Aid as an ability? üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Correct.</msg>
  <mbspell>Evelyn (Tilda) chooses First Aid as her ability.</mbspell>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Some of the abilities are tied to a class, let's separate them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">There are actual Healer class abilities. May I change my choice?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Yes you may, until everyone is ready.</msg>
  <mbspell>Evelyn (Tilda) changes her ability to Cure.</mbspell>
  <mbspell>P4 (Filch) chooses Dodge as her ability.</mbspell>
  <mbspell>Casey (Nez} chooses Protect as her ability.</mbspell>
  <mbspell>Sasha (Collin) chooses Give Order as her ability.</mbspell>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) Now I shuffle the Encounters deck and place it on the story control board. As I do so, I notice that the encounter cards have two types. Some have a black E on the back, the others have a red E. We will find out what they foretell.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) Next I set up tiles 2, 4, 5 as shown on the manual.
  <msg spk="Zoey">The manual didn't show the tile numbers. I think it would be quicker if they did.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) The mice will start on Tile 5: The Guard Room. There I also place 3 rat warriors. The rules on page 14 says when placing small melee minions, they should be spread out as much as possible. Therefore, in this case there is only one way to place them: One on each spawn point.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Helmet is special if searched by a tinkerer. And this tile will only spawn more rat warriors (2 each) time when the story timer advances.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think this game would play better with a GM, because the GM can deal out the tiles one by one and hide the details about the rules.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) As GM, right after the part Maginos said, "Quick, to the Sewer", I would present the first tile (The Guard Room) with the minis already set up.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think that would be quite dramatic. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I have an idea, why don't we write a step by step script for a GM to present the game? Right now the Story book doesn't do so because it assumes the reader already read the rules. It doesn't even have hints that the player should be doing something standard.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) Take the one Rat Warriors initiative card and shuffle it with that of the four selected heroes. Then reveal them on the initiative tracker starting from the top.
  <mbspell>The order is Rat Warriors &gt; Nez &gt; Collin &gt; Filch &gt; Tilda.</mbspell>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) Since Collin is not first, his Born to Lead ability gives him one cheese.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> (GM) The rats go first. For each rat, roll one die for movement and move the rat toward the closest hero. Then attack anyone within its melee range. In our case the bottom rat willl attack Nez because he is higher on the scale.

      <div class=""><b>At the Blogger at Magic Bakery,</b> a Post is dashboard layout to display contents stored in an archive. This is not the typical way Blogger sites work, but we are mimicking the intended organization when the site is upgrade to use databases.</div>
      <div class="">
        <h4>What is a Dashboard?</h4>
        ‚≠ê A dashboard is something that each user may create to view contents of the archive.<br>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h4>What Should be a Post?</h4>
        ‚≠ê Chapters<br>
        ‚≠ê For now, also Calendars<br>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h4>How do I reference something in the archive?</h4>
        ‚≠ê Each data object in the archive has a unique ID and labels. <br>
        ‚≠ê The tag <code>[jq]</code> can reference the data.<br>
        ‚≠ê To reference a specific object, such as this guide: <code>[jq]#P202207160804&lt;/jq&gt;</code><br>

    <div class="" So.       <lnk>202207160804|What is a Post?</lnk>

    </div><hr class="">
    <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> For blogger sites in general, there are two main ways to display content: Post and Page.
    <msg spk="Ivy">A Post is the default way blogger gives us to post content. A Post shows a timestamp, it is automatically listed on the front page and calendar control, and it allows labels.</msg>
    <msg spk="Ivy">A Page is does not have a timestamp and is not automatically created. The admin would need to create a link to link to a Page. Typically this is done at the top navigation bar or at the side bar.</msg>
    <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> For <i>OUR</i> blogger site, we use Post and Page quite differently. So what I will talk about below is more like a proposal.
    <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I propose that we separate the data and the layout by using Post as a dashboard layout, and Page as data archive. I think this will make it easier when we migrate to a website that has a database.
    <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> In Magic Bakery terminology, only Chapters and perhaps Calendars should be a Post. Everything else should be in a Page.
    <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Zoey:</b> I have a question about this arrangement. If we organize it like this, does it mean there can only be one archive? Do we end up having a centralized system?
    <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> My answer is we want to have a decentralized system, but first we need to know how to make at least one system with database. In a decentralized and cross-checking system, which is the way Quest Society data should be maintained, each data center is making copies of the data of another center, but each center by itself can be considered a centralized node.
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> What is the plan to handle object ID's? Will they still be unique across all nodes?
    <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> That will be handled the same way as URL. Each node has its own unique domain ID. The full unique ID of an object would have the domain path.
    <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> So even though we know that <hl>the final Quest System would be decentralized,</hl> I propose that our current focus to be on a single centralized system. We are trying to make one node first, then we will make it work with other nodes in an alliance.
    <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I see. I think this overall plan should be somewhere.
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree will add to 
    <lnk>202207142015|üé™ Quest Board</lnk>!
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> If a post should only be a dashboard, does it mean there should only be about 30 posts right now?
    <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Correct. Of the 99 posts now, most of them should have its content sent to an archive.
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> The archive is becoming slow as it gets bigger. Is there something we can do about it?
    <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> We could split it into multiple archives based on the data date. But that mechanism is only for Blogger. When we migrade to a database, that would be implied. For now I suggest just using VSC or other editor to edit it locally. Then just copy and paste to the archive.
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> But if I am stitching data back to the archive, I would need to keep the Archive open for a long time, then no one can edit anything.
    <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> If you just want to test the HTML before adding it to the Archive, you could test it at a temporary post first. Then when you are done, you could copy that to the Archive. Then if something breaks in your code, it won't break the entire site.
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Okay. I think I can do that.
    <mbkudo><b>Evelyn thanks all for the guide.</b></mbkudo>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Please support @Arena in clearing all those quests.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Hmm... And @Arena should also be a quest. So we should also define that as a quest.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think we need to do that, and define profiles of the contestants as ID'ed objects. Right now they merely have an ID, but they are not objects in the archive.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> How many different objects do we need to make?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> A philosophy can have multiple champions. So each philosophy should be an object, and each champion should be an object. After that, each challenge, contest, and combat should be an object.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I don't think we should spend a lot of time juggling data. Otherwise we would be spending time making new bins instead of adding substance to the bins.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Then let's try continue in the new way when we add something.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think we should define @Arena as a quest, otherwise it won't show up on the quest list.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, could you define @Arena as a quest object?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> It is now defined!
  <lnk>202207161224|üèõÔ∏è Philosophy Arena</lnk>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Next let's define an ideology object. Since StarTree is here, let's define Veganism.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Roger!</msg>
  <lnk>202207161233|ü•¶ Veganism</lnk>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Now add StarTree as a Champion object.
  <lnk>P02207110924|üèÖ Veganism</lnk>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Next, add flex containers to list all philosophy and champion objects in arena quest.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Done!</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">This looks kind of fun when you don't need to do it yourself.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree is happy for helping people!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">StarTree, I think the object picture of the champion should be you.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Hai!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Since there was already an ID, the object should use the same ID. And on the category title, instead of "Champion", please say "Veganism". And add back the four hearts.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Roger!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">And make the picture 100 px please. StarTree is cute!</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Wee~~!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Now at the original arena page, add jq tag for Champions and remove the original StarTree.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Hold on. If you do that, the ranking order won't be preserved.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think we shouldn't manually set the ranking order. The ranking order should be automatically done with javascript. StarTree please add a todo item for Arena to implementing ranking order code.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think we should also add the other todo items.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">StarTree please add those with priority above the ranking code.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Done!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Since we will be making the other champion profiles similarly, let's complete StarTree's profile first. What should go in StarTree's profile?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think that will be her moves. But that is irrelevant until we fight.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Actually what is the intended difference between Philosophy and Champion?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Philosophy is non-RP. So if I want to talk about it on discussion, I could just link to that without the gamification.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Zoey:</b> Then should StarTree's champion profile have a link to Veganism?
  <msg spk="Ledia">Yes it should.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> StarTree, please add Veganism as something you are a champion of.
  <msg spk="Ledia">Can a champion be a champion of multiple philosophies?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The way we define it now, no. Since each Champion profile has hit points, and hits points are tied to a specific philosophy. But I think the "Champion of" section can have multiple items.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> StarTree could you replace the picture for Veganism? And in Veganism, I think there shouldn't be StarTree's photo.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Shouldn't there be a "Championed by" section in Veganism?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I agree with Evelyn. But I think Tanya will object.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I prefer having something that is completely factual. By that I mean everything on Veganism should be about Veganism itself. So I agree with Ledia.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> That has to do with how Tanya intends to use it. We had many debates about that regarding Albatross. But, Tanya, if you are okay with Logical Fallacy Dungeon to have gaming elements in it, why is it not okay for Philosophy objects to have gaming elements also?
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think the audience that would read the philosophy object would be the more serious type. If you keep one to be more serious, then you could choose to use the Champion link or the Philosophy link. On the Philosophy object I plan to link to more URL and articles outside Magic Bakery.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Okay. I understand. That might be a good way to separate RP and non-RP content.
  <mbcomplete>Ivy's request to create reference links for profiles is complete.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Well I marked that done because you bit the bullet and made the actual object. So we don't need the reference link anymore. Congratulations.
  <mbkudo><b>Ivy thanks all for the upgrade.</b></mbkudo>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Could we not use that idiom? It has a very graphical and unpleasant origin. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Apologies.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> We're just about done with the garnish. Let's add the definition from Wiki: "Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."
  <mbcomplete>Ledia and StarTree got EXP for adding a definition of Veganism.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think we should also add links to the Vegan Society and wikipedia.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Now that looks minimally complete.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Should there be a collection of philosophies for people to browse to another philosophy node on our site?
  <msg spk="Ledia">I would say yes. If an object belongs to a collection, having a link back to its collection should be required.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">StarTree please make a Collection object for Philosophies, and create another object that is a Collection of Collections.</msg>

          <h4>Definition</h4>
          Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.

                Impartial philosophies follow Reciprocative Justice "You may treat someone the way they treat others" and establishes an unbiased basis of conflict resolution that makes them especially important for world peace as a foundation of inter-society arbitration.

                Preferential philosophies, while possibly peaceful, have additional commitments that could be beneficial but not strictly necessary for world peace. They can serve as role models but they need to let people quit for other peaceful societies they prefer.

  <msg spk="Sasha">I still don't know what the rules should be. Are we trying to compare military strengths? What is a fight?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I thought a fight is a debate presented as a duel. But the content of the debate allows the champion to use military force. For example, if the debate topic is territorial dispute, Imperialism could say they will take over the territory by force, and the opponent can't just say, "If you do that the other nations will attack you" because the assumption is that the two philosophies are on a duel arena--There are no other forces.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I suppose this can count as daily reading. üòÖ
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> In summary, a notorious thief and master of disguise Gilly Niles has been seen casing the area around Trafalgar Square. We are to figure out what she is up to and stop her plan.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Material availble are a directoy, map, informants and newspaper.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Do we just read everything at the leads?
  <msg spk="Tanya">If we want to pretend that we are actually doing this, there would be a cost for each lead we choose to follow.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>P4:</b> Where is Trafalgar Square?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is not a number place but south of National Gallery 24 WC.</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">üíü</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> If she has been casing around there, I suppose what she wants to steal is somewhere nearby.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> The newspaper says someone probably has a diamond at Grand Hotel 22 WC. I think that is probably the target. There is also a painting at the National Gallery, but it has been there since September 1st. So I think the target is the diamond.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Since she is a master of disguise, potentially she would pretend to tbe the anonymous buyer of the diamond and just take it without paying.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> We need to pick a location for the first lead. Do we agree that we will go to Grand Hotel?
  <msg spk="P4">I want to visit the Unicorn 19 WC. I want to know what it is.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Let's visit there after solving it. üòä</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">The Unicorn is probably a pub, you can't get in XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Oh üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I nuke Zoey for using a mimic. There was no age limit for drink back in 1880.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I wasn't talking about the age limit, I was talking about Evelyn XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But you all went to a tavern back in Adventurer Begins.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That was because that was the only choice. There was no inn that wasn't also a tavern and we needed a place to lodge. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Zoey, are you counter attacking Sasha?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">No, I'll just brush it off. I don't want to KO Sasha. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Zoey you may draw a Level 3 treasure card.</msg>

  <msg spk="Casey">The last thing I remembered was the rat was attacking us, but we didn't know how attack works.</msg>

    <div class=""><b>The</b> newly transformed heroes found themselves being chased by guards transformed into rat warriors in King Andon's castle dungeon. To escape, they must escape down the sewer through paths yet unknown to them to where they could get a breather.
    <msg spk="Cardinal">This is a continuation of Team Cheese Cake's play through of Mice &amp; Mystics.</msg>
    <msg spk="Cardinal">This post follows Tanya's RP convention: CHAT for RP (plus GM Narration) and BUBBLE for non-RP.</msg>
   
    </div><hr class="">
    <msg spk="Cardinal">The initiative order since last game is Rat Warriors &gt; Nez &gt; Collin &gt; Filch &gt; Tilda.</msg>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> In the Guard Room with the heroes are three Rat Warriors. Maginos, who was instrumental in giving the heroes a slim chance of escape, is out-of-mana. He could not fight but is well awake and aware of the situation.
    <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> Meanwhile, one Rat Warrior had caught up to the heroes and swung its sword at Nez, the Tinkerer Warrior.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Cardinal:</b> (Rat Warrior) ‚öîÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è</hide>
    <div></div><b>Cardinal:</b> The Rat Warrior swung its jagged knife as hard as he could toward the group, even if that left him wide open for counter attacks.
    <msg spk="Cardinal">@Casey, roll for your defense.</msg>
    <msg spk="Casey">(Nez the Tinkerer) My defense value is only 1, and I have no armor. Does this mean that I will get one wound no matter what?</msg>

    <div></div><div class="">‚öîÔ∏è</div><b>Casey:</b> Nez didn't finch. In fact he had had enough seeing Queen Vanestra's ruffians around the castle he had fought hard to defend as a former soldier.
    <msg spk="Casey">I think I am the strongest here, so I will just attack.</msg>

    <msg spk="Casey">Alright.</msg>

    <msg spk="P4">Ok.</msg>
    <msg spk="P4">Is it okay if Filch is a nice person?</msg>
    <msg spk="Sasha">Filch's story says he has continued "inability to ingratiate himself to those who would provide shelter."</msg>
    <msg spk="P4">What does that mean?</msg>
    <msg spk="Sasha">It means he doesn't do anything nice to others even when they do something nice to hiim.</msg>
    <msg spk="P4">üòü</msg>
    <msg spk="Tanya">If we want to keep the roleplay by the book, I suggest Sasha and P4 trade character.</msg>
    <msg spk="Sasha">I see what you mean now. But I already took a turn.</msg>
    <msg spk="Tanya">But that was just the first turn.</msg>

    <msg spk="P4">I want to play Filch but I don't want to be mean.</msg>
    <msg spk="Evelyn">I hope Filch will change into a good person during the story. It says he is unable to be grateful, maybe he wants to be grateful. üòÖ</msg>
    <msg spk="Cardinal">P4, how about you are playing the better self of Filch? You are the good voice in Filch tell him to do good, but Filch also has a selfish voice telling him to care for himself. For every decision that is kind, you will roll one die. If you win it works as you intended. If you lose, I decide what Filch will do instead, but you get one cheese.</msg>

    <msg spk="Evelyn">Filch is now closest to the last Rat Warrior. üòñ</msg>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Although Nez was wounded, Tilda worries about Filch, who seems to be unaware that the third Rat Warrior was about to hit him.

    <msg spk="Zoey">Tilda became a looter! XD</msg>
    <msg spk="Evelyn">But there is nothing else to do üòÖ I will think of the RP reason if I actually get a card, since searching only works half the time.</msg>
    <msg spk="Tanya">We missed a rule. P4 still had to roll for search to get the Tinkerer's Treasure card.</msg>
    <msg spk="Evelyn">üòñ</msg>

  <div class=""><b>There</b> is a quest that will greatly affect Evelyn's life. So I want to get our attention to complete it ASAP.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> As you might notice, recently Evelyn had stopped importing the old post to Blogger, and the Great Detective Sasha determined that the reason was she didn't want to import twice if we are going to change the format as Ivy had suggested multiple times.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I'm sorry! I'll start again tomorrow. üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> My point was you were right waiting. The blog needs to catch up so that you won't waste your effort. The long the blog isn't upgraded to the intended format, the more work there would be for Evelyn. So I say, Let's do it. Right now. Let define the new format, and write the code for it.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So, this morning I made a post, or I should say, a <i>node</i> in the archive. Its ID is P202207191024. If you try to display that in Viewer or JQ that node, you will see that it has not format at the top and it is missing a frame around it.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Now, if you look at the node at the Archive, you will see that the unformatted parts have tags: "node-category", "node-title", "node-img", "node-content".
  <msg spk="Sasha">I took the liberty to define them because I think they are easy to change later if we want.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> What I understand is that when the Javascript code is told to read data from the node, if the content is tagged properly, the JS code should be able to construct the clickable title that we are familiar with.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Does anyone understand what I said so far?
  <div></div><div class="" can decide to show a clickable row, a small thumbnail, a big thumbnail, a game card, or a tarot sized card.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes. But that is as far as I understand. What do we need to <i>DO</i> to make that happen?</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We need to edit the JS function that fetches the data from the Archive. @StarTree, what function is that?
  <div></div><div class=""!
  <msg spk="StarTree">"Macro" is the function that reads "jq" tags get the data, then replace the "jq" tag with the actual data!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Does that mean we only need to change "Macro"?
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree is not sure! Macro scans the specified section for tags, then calls "QueryAllReplace", which does the magic for each tag that Macro found!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> It looks like QueryAllNext is what we need to change. QueryAllNext doesn't call anything else made by us.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> StarTree, why are there so much commented code in that function?
  <msg spk="StarTree">Ivy tried to added an alias feature so that a node could be referred to by multiple names, but it didn't work.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">If Ivy couldn't make it work... üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> What I was trying to do was different and not as important as so I just left it alone. If you want to try something, I suggest you make a copy of QueryAllReplace and just specifically run that at the Test Area. Then you won't break the rest of the while testing.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Understood.</msg>
  <mbspell>Tanya created QueryAllReplace2.</mbspell>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> How do we actually run this function by itself at Test Area?
  <msg spk="Ivy">You could make a button and call it with fixed arguments.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Wow, I feel like I asked something really basic!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">If you don't want the button itself to disappear, then comment out the part that removes the button. Then you don't need to refresh the page just to test again.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It is spamming Sasha's charter XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's try making some changes instead of just pushing the button.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Okay. Enough spamming.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's confirm that we can alter the content of what it displays.
  <mbmerit>Tanya confirmed how to set what is displayed.</mbmerit>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Good job, you are halfway there.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Sasha:</b> Wait, I want to do something also, let's take turn making a change. Baker Street Irregulars style.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Ok. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Hmm...</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> May I make the change first? I have an idea XD
  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes you may. That is Cardinal Style Initiative.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">That's a lot of changes. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I'm just adding the button back. Okay let's try it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It's not loading.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">OMG I broke the site XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">It is the quotation marks. You can change them to single quotes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It's working!</msg>
  <mbmerit>Zoey enabled the button code.</mbmerit>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> It is clear that we need to replace the dummy "TITLE" and "CONTENT" with the actual content from the node. How do we read the tags?
  <msg spk="Ivy">Google is where you could ask that kind of question. But I'll just show you this, then I think you can finish it.</msg>
  <mbmerit>Ivy demonstrated how to read values in a tag.</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Now I take my turn.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It's working! üòÉ</msg>
  <mbmerit>Sasha replaced the placeholder with actual values from the node.</mbmerit>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Now Evelyn can continue!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> We formatted the wrong thing. We made the format for a conversation post, but P202207191024 is a charter, so the button should not be plain text but with a thumbnail.
  <msg spk="Zoey">But Evelyn is mostly going to import conversation posts.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We need a way to know that the content is a conversation post... Actually, we need a way to tell if our code should be used at all. If we just add this code back to QueryAllNext, the rest of the archive can't display because none of them have the "node-content" tag.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Then I shall take my turn and protect the rest of the archive.</msg>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><div class="".
  <msg spk="Tanya">I am adding a test button so show what happens if we run QueryAllReplace2 on an old post.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">The old post doesn't display at all üòñ üè≥Ô∏è</msg>
  <mbmerit>Tanya's new test button caught the error.</mbmerit>
  <mbmerit>Ivy fixed the error.</mbmerit>
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> When "get" finds nothing, the result is not null. It is a zero length collection.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Thank you.üòñ</msg>
  <mbmerit>Evelyn's IF statement can now distinguish the old type and new type.</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class="" for my turn.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">CUTE !! üòç</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Thanks for using the pudding.</msg>
  <mbmerit>Zoey brought back the icon.</mbmerit>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Next is the participants list...</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I think it is time to wrap up. If you want, you could add your changes back to QueryAllReplace, so Sasha's charter can at least display like a story post at the calendar.
  <msg spk="Tanya">It's not working. The calendar doesn't call QueryAll Replace.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Apparently the calendar does something different. It doesn't even have run Macro.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">And if you add Macro it won't do anything because Sasha's node doesn't have any jq tag.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. We need to make what added as a function and let calendar call it by itself.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">And that is not working.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> The problem seems to be that the calendar doesn't fetch a node one by one. This means that your function would not work if the input argument is not just a single node but a list of nodes.
  <msg spk="Tanya">What is the query string that calendar uses?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">It is "[date='20220719']"!</msg>
  <mbmerit>Tanya added the test to Test Area and confirmed the issue.</mbmerit>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> We need to loop through each top level object.
  <mbmerit>Tanya created the looping version of "NodeFormatter".</mbmerit>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We could change the name later.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> It is working! üòÉ
  <msg spk="Ivy">Impressive. üëç</msg>

        <div class=""></div>
        Honorism views virtues as personal voluntary commitments. People who do not commit to practicing those virtues are considered neutral.

          You may commit yourself to helping others. But when you declare that "others have a responsibility to help", you cross a line where you no longer view those people as neutral. Your ideology becomes a control paradigm that attacks the neutral by branding them as irresponsible. üê£<hr>

        <div class=""></div> <b>Q:</b> Why can honorism stop aggression when it claims that does not subscribe others to the same commitment? 
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Natalie:</b> When an aggressor subjects others to violence, the aggressor subscribes itself to an arena where opposition by force is okay. Honorism can then join that arena to intervene.</hide><br>
        <div class=""></div> <b>Q:</b> What if the victim is at the brink of extinction? Can they force others to help them? 
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Natalie:</b> Honorism: Victims surviving by dishonorable means are less guilty than the aggressor creating the conflict. It is unjust to act against the victim without acting more against the aggressor.</hide><br>
        <div class=""></div> <b>Q:</b> How does joining a conflict and opposing aggression make peace? If the victim concedes then the aggressor won't need to attack and no one dies.
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Natalie:</b> Subjugation is seizing one's free life. Lack of opposition allows aggressors break peace.</hide><br>

        <div class=""></div> <b>Q:</b> I am a bystander, but the aggressor threatens to harm me if anyone tries to stop it. Can I hold people against the aggressor accountable for the consequence affecting me if the aggressor goes berserk?
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Natalie:</b> Holding helper (instead of the aggressor) accountable is anti-help, that is beyond being neutral (Neutral: I don't help, but if the aggressor goes berserk I blame the aggressor.)  Anti-help is not neutral, it is a form of aggression.</hide><br>

  Magic Bakery</small></center><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div>
  <div class=""><b>Wishcraft</b> 101 is a discussion series about how to collect and fulfill wishes. Those were the founding purpose of Magic Bakery. This particular discussion thread will be especially disorganized because I want to talk about the outline and also a wish that we could fulfill at the same time. 
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think that it would be easier to brainstorm if we have a wish as a context. So here it goes.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> For example, say someone says, "I wish to finish this jigsaw puzzle." That can mean to things:
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> 1) They wish that the puzzle jigsaw puzzle is complete, regardless <i>who</i> does it.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> 2) They wish that <i>they themself</i> have the leisure time to finish the puzzle by themself. They could mean that they wish that they don't need to work so they have spare time to do whatever they want to accomplish.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Both wishes are valid wishes, a wish collector needs to tell the difference.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> So in this case, do you wish to write this guide by yourself, or do you wish to have this guide written regardless who writes it?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> You are a little bit ahead. To answer your question, my wish is that the guide is written regardless who writes it. But what I was getting at, is that at Magic Bakery, <i>That</i> is the default meaning of a wish.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> The Magic Bakery definition of a wish is a desired for an outcome regardless who fulfills it. That is the only way that Arcacia could get the permission to be involved.
  <mbaa>Little Red Riding Hood receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> For example, if you wish for "world peace', it means that you let go of wanting to make a difference in the world and let the world make itself peaceful. This doesn't mean that you should do nothing when there is an opportunity to help. But it means that you are not trying to be important as you do it.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> If you try to do it yourself, Arcacia would pick up that desire and let you do it by yourself.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Vivi:</b> Then why can't I just wish for being important in getting immediate good result?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I suppose you can.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think this concept is similar to the visualization technique. There you would imagine the good result in the present tense. But that technique is also different from making a wish, since the practitioner is thnking in future tense.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> So, for example if you wish that the world is peaceful, what you condition yourself is "I am a peacemaker." You are not prescribing or predicting what you <i>will</i> do to make the world more peaceful. Instead, you just declare that that is who you are, without judging whether the world right now it peaceful or not.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Then in every challenge you face, you act in accordance to your self-assigned role as a peacemaker.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> But that means that the first lesson of making a wish is to NOT make a wish. Then we don't need Wishcraft 101, we need Selfcraft 101.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Let's have a comparison. In Guild Log, Black said he wanted to learn Japanese. @Black, is that wish current?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Black:</b> It is current but low priority. And when I say wish, I am using the Magic Bakery meaning. I wouldn't mind if I just wake up tomorrow and be fluent in Japanese.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> According to Evelyn, instead of thinking that "I wish that I will become fluent in Japanese", you would instead say, "I AM a fluent Japanese speaker."
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> It is slightly different üòñ, the present tense-role should be "I am a Japanese learner." In that declaration, you are telling yourself that, since you are a Japanese learner, you would do what a Japanese learner does. For example, if you don't know how something is said in Japanese, you would look it up. If you find an opportunity to practice Japanese, you would take it. It ties into Atomic Habits, where the identify is the trigger.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> That doesn't just tie into Atomic Habits, that IS Atomic Habit. Atomic Habit and Visualization overlap in that regard.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> And what is the comparison? What would Red did in terms of Wishcraft?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> In Wishcraft, we would post that as a quest for people to gather the best learning materials and methods. We would give credits for studying Japanese because that is no different from say the reading club. We will present the best resources we gathered and present it in a cute way.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> So the difference between Wishcraft and Visualization is that in Visualization, you are basically telling the person to go fulfill their own wish. While in Wishcraft, you would take that wish and create a supporting community to not help not only the person making a wish, but anyone else who are interested in learning or to help.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I thought I lost but Vivi made it sound so awesome. üç∞üç∞üç∞
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> They don't contradict. You can do both at the same time. You are creating a supportive community for learners and help them see themselves as proactive learners.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> So what is the best resource we know?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> There were some training methods where you get a list of most common phrases and keywords and just memorize those. As you use it daily, you would pick up the rest, including correcting the errors.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think <i>how best to learn</i> will evolve and could be different for each learner. But in Wishcraft, the first step is to create a place for people to share. That means we make a quest for it. A guide quest. And by now we have a few guides in the making so we should also have a collection node for guides.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> @StarTree.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Hai!
  <mbcomplete>StarTree created a guide quest "Learning Japanese".</mbcomplete>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> I don't want StarTree talking to me in Japanese all of a sudden.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then where can we do Japanese?
  <msg spk="Vivi">Isn't that what the guide section is for?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I thought it is fun if we talk in Japanese sometimes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">No it is not. If I start seeing language I don't understand, I assume I am not invited and would stop reading it. It is off-putting because the site itself is not about Japanese.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree is doing it wrong! üò≠</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">It is fine if the post is about Japanese.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I agree that we should be kind to the reader. The reader is our guest. Maybe if we use other languages in normal discussion, we should at least put the translation next to it?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Added üò≠</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Do we get a daily quest for adding to the Japanese guide or practicing? Like the reading club?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Yes, but the Japanese Guide quest is on EPIC C schedule. So please keep in mind that the credit is for helping, not for adding each word. So if you add a hundred words a day, you still only get 1 point.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Yes I know, we don't count how many pages we read either. XD</msg>

            There is probably no wrong ways to making wishes, but at Magic Bakery, a wish is something someone wants to happen regardless who makes that happen. However, since this is not a wide-spread understanding, it is okay if the wish maker is ambiguous. The wish collector is supposed to confirm the meaning so that they don't beat you to what you want to accomplish by yourself.

            Sometimes wishes don't look like wishes. For example, someone is angry and complaining. But behind what they are angry at, there is something they want to happen instead. Collecting wishes is about identifying those desired outcomes even when the speak is not using the magical phrase, "I wish something something happens."

            Sometimes people wish for others to get hurt. At Magic Bakery, those types of wishes are called curses. You could try to create a wish out of it. Other than that we don't have a policy of dealing with those. It is a potential discussion topic.

            Every member may choose one wish they want to focus on and pin it on the board. You may pin another wish over your existing one. The point is your posts shouldn't take up all the spaces.

            Many people wished for world peace. So we are not going to do that. We'will hand it to Arcacia because if we try to do it she would stop. Instead, we would just play and learn about what others do. It's all yours, Arcacia. <mbaa>LRRH receives</mbaa>

  <div class=""><b>For</b> the new Daily Quest on learning Japanese I am proposing memorizing lyrics as an activity.
  <msg spk="Zoey">If you have a better idea please propose.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">And you may speak Japanese in this thread. ‚úå</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Advantages I see of learning by lyrics:
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Number 1 reason: It is fun and happy.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Number 2 reason: It repeats, which help in memorization.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> With this proposal I made a node and posted the lyrics here:
  <lnk>202207220712|Endoro-Ru!</lnk>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I posted the kanji version because that is the end result: to know how to read it and what it means.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> You may find the romanji and translation on a different link there. You could make it more convenient by turning some lyrics into buttons to display romanji and translation. But you should need to click on it for it to display. If it is shown all the time you can't test whether you can't test your understanding.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Same goes for each section of the lyrics. By default they are hidden behind the section code. This is for memorizing the whole song.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> ‰ª•‰∏ä„Åß„Åô
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Cute song!! üòç
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I added a note for a kanji.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Yes, the first step should be to add notes that will help you memorize. At this point the most important focus should be how to read what you can't read.
  <msg spk="LRRH">I also added my own translation.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Good job!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> I don't see any translation.

  <msg spk="LRRH">That's the first line I couldn't read. üê£</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">What about people who can't read any?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">As a Japanese learner, you could add the note from the first line you don't understand. You may do so by copying the romanji and the translation.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It is self-paced, there is no deadline or anything.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> So for the daily quest, do I just pick a line and add the romanji and translation in html?
  <msg spk="Zoey">Yes, I think that is enough effort.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">üëç</msg>
  <mbcomplete>Black added notes to a line also.</mbcomplete>

  <msg spk="Zoey">Thank you.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Wee~!
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> Hmm... It won't make sense if I break apart some sentence into two parts. So I translate them together.

      <div class=""><b>Decision Rule</b> refers to a practice of defining what a decision should be given a circumstance before the circumstance happens. Decision rules are normally designed to make a decision transparent and objective, to make the decisions consistent, and to reduce the time it takes to make a decision.</div>
      <div class="">
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        ‚≠ê Rules that determine the winner of a competition.<br>
        ‚≠ê A computer algorithm that does schedule planning.<br>
        ‚≠ê An emergency response protocol<br>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        ‚≠ê A list of rules<br>
        ‚≠ê A decision tree<br>
        ‚≠ê A decision flow chart<br>
        ‚≠ê A decision table<br>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h4>Difference between decision rule and chain of command</h4>
        A chain of command defines who has the authority to make a decision whereas a decision rule defines what the decision should be regardless who is "in command".
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h4>Difference between a decision rule and a law</h4>
        A law may only define what is illegal, whereas a decision rule will define how to tell if a person has violated the law. Well-defined decision rules would replaces judges.

  <div class=""><b>I</b> had a problem where I could forget to bring back my laptop from home when I go to work. So I tried a very cheap solution and it has been working well. Could you guess the solution?
  <msg spk="Black">More about the context: I transfer the laptop in a backpack. When I am home, I take the laptop from the backpack, then put it on my desk at a dock. The next morning, if I forgot about it, I would just take the backpack and go. What did I do so this doesn't happen?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Did you stop bringing it home?
  <msg spk="Black">Everything I said above still happen, I am still transporting the laptop in a backpack, docking it at home, etc. But I added something so I won't forget bringing the laptop..</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>P4:</b> Did you tie the laptop to the backpack?
  <msg spk="Black">In that idea, when would I tie the laptop to the backpack?</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">When you take it out of the backpack?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">But I could take it out without tying it, correct? My method doesn't require me to remember that added step.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So you added a step that you would not forget. What does that mean? You could forget everything.
  <msg spk="Black">Would you forget to wear shoes when you go out?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">No.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Why not?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Because the moment I step outside barefoot it would feel dirty.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">A step that you can't forget has something similar.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I see a pun XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">üëç</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""? I think that's what I would do.
  <msg spk="Black">I thought about that, but what do you do with that note once you put the laptop in the backpack?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Maybe leave it at the location where you would normally put the backpack at home? Then when you try to put the backpack there, you see the note so you would take it and put it on the backpack.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Your method is close to mine, but I think mine is more foolproof. In your case, if I decide to put the backpack else where, or if I put did not notice the note and put the backpack on it, then the mechanism is defeated.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Did you put the note at the dock when you leave? Then the only way to defeat that is if you take the laptop out but do not dock it. If you dock it everytime, you would see the note at the dock. At which point you would put that note to the backpack.
  <msg spk="Black">This is extremely close. So I will tell what I did:</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Instead of using a note, I used a rubberband. When I leave, I loop the rubberband around the dock such that it is impossible to dock the laptop without remove it. Then when I remove it to dock the laptop, I tie the rubberband at my backpack opening such that I can't put the backpack inside without removing the rubberband.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is clever. üòÉ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Now if you understand this solution, I have another question: At work, I have a key that I insert at whichever computer I happen to work with. Sometimes I forget to remove it when I am doing working at that computer. How do I not forget?
  <msg spk="Black">You don't have to apply the same solution I did with my laptop. I'm asking for any good solution.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I have a solution, but that is because I know more about the context, that you didn't describe in your puzzle.
  <msg spk="Black">Please describe that context.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The context is this: Most of the time, the computer Black services already has a key. Black takes that key out and insert his own key when he works on that computer. And most typically, when he services a computer, he also brings his laptop.
  <msg spk="Tanya">So here is my solution: When you remove the original key, attach it to your laptop so that you can't close your laptop without noticing it. When you see that it should remind you to retrieve your key.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">I understand your solution, but my laptop doesn't have a convenient way to attach a key to it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> How about you add a detachable bracelet to your key? When you insert it to another computer, you remove it and tie it to yourself. Maybe it would also have bells so you would hear it if you walk around without your key.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Cute! üòâ</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">I think bells would be too distracting to myself and people around. And I think if I tie the keychain to somewhere I would notice all the time it would also be distracting. For example, where would I tie it?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Then about a piece of tape? Keep the tape on the key so you can't insert it without taking it off. When you take it off, stick it to your laptop so it can't close.
  <msg spk="Black">That is something I would try, Except my laptop doesn't have that hook latch, so a piece of tape can't prevent it from closing.</msg>

        <div class=""></div>
        Consider the following dialogue where Bob replies to Ann's comment.
        <div class="">
          <b>[1] Ann:</b> "Compassion is the motivation to be kind and considerate. If a person buys out something without considering that someone else might need them, then the person is not acting out of compassion."<br>
          <b>[2] Bob:</b> "It is unfair to ask each person to consider the needs of everyone in the city as no one has a reasonable way of doing so."
        </div>
        Ann's comment did not say that anyone is demanding compassion. While's Ann may agree with Bob that it is unfair to ask each person to consider everyone, Bob's reply is a strawman. His statement attacked Ann by making Ann sounds unfair to a casual reader. Without using a strawman reply, Bob could have said this:
        <div class="">
          <b>[2a] Bob:</b> "The definition of compassion should include everything that is fair. Since it is unfair to ask each person to consider the needs of everyone, compassion does not require a person to consider everyone. And, since it is fair for a person to consider only themself as long as they don't hurt anyone else, compassion includes not considering others at all."<br>
        </div>
        If that is what Bob means, Bob's reply would not be a strawman, but Bob's definition would still be at risk of <lnk>202208011038|Black-or-White fallacy</lnk>, because he has equated "compassion" and "fair demand", when the two concepts could be independent:

  <msg spk="LRRH">Something that makes the room dark, so that the heroes can only see what is in front of them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">A light-eater.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">What kind of monster is that?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I've just made up the name.</msg>

  <msg spk="LRRH">If the OP had correct statistics, they could show whether it includes Indians. So if the source is strong enough, then the monster is defeated.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Little Red Riding Hood had identified a dark elemental.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The Dark Elemental is sucking the lights from the torches.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey observes the torches carefully.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I am trying to find the source of those torches. The claim from the OP didn't seem believable to begin with. Maybe the torches are also monsters.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">And I couldn't find the source to that "fact.".</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey couldn't find any light source big enough to defeat this dark element. "I think we should just leave it be."
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> As the heroes waited, the dark elemental shrinks into a dormant statge, three treasure chests appeared before the heroes.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Ledia, you may get a Level 1 treasure. Zoey a Level 2 treasure, and Red a Level 4 treasure.</msg>

  <msg spk="StarTree">Yes it is!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey is very curious what the big chest would have, but opens the medium chest because she thinks Red should get the big chest.

  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> At this rate Red will graduate first, so we shouldn't rely on her sealing them in the wild. We should seal them ourselves.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Little Red Riding Hood doesn't mind keep doing what she has always been doing.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> But for our training purpose, we should get some experience spotting them in the wild.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Then what do you wish me to do?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I am not trying to change what you do, I'm just saying Zoey and I should try to spot monsters also.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> To me I think that means if Red spots a monster, just go ahead and finish it. You don't need to save it for us. We are supposed to also go and spot them as part of the training.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Okay.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> If I complete the Cleric track, do I continue with the Fighter track then the Wizard track?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Yes, if you want.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Then Little Red Riding Hood wants to be on the Wizard track.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Anyone object to a name change? The first 10K points is for an "Initiate". The next 10K is for "Guardian". The third 10K is for "Veteran". That can be combined with your role title. So Ledia is "Fighter Initiate", and Zoey is "Rogue Initiate."
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> If we are changing that I want to be "Ranger Initiate." XD
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Yes that's fine. And these titles are only for this dungeon.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I'm fine with that.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I am fine with that also. What happens after 30K points?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Maybe you get a star for very 10K more?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Little Red Riding Hood wants stars.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Should we get a star for every 10K we complete? Then a Guardian will have at least one star, and Veteran has at least two stars.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I'll take that idea.
  <mbcomplete>The chamber is cleared by the initiates.</mbcomplete>

      <hide><hr><div class=""></div>
        Providing an anecdote is logically valid when you are trying to show that a situation exists.<h4>Example 1</h4>
        <b>Tom:</b> I have seen you get mad playing this game, so you can't say people don't get mad player it. I've seen many people get mad playing this game.<br>
        <h4>Example 2</h4>
        <b>Jason:</b> It can happen, I was the one who was eliminated.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> Would the style be similar to Chapter 10 Page 10? In front of the Gate Temple?
  <msg spk="Ivy">We need each manga page to have its own ID... So we could reference them.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I hope that layout doesn't block the path to the temple when there is an arena event.

  <msg spk="Evelyn">How about the center of Stewardship council? What else is that space for?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">That's a lodging area, where people rest. The area in front of the Gate Temple is already a tourist area and can be noisy.</msg>

  <msg spk="Evelyn">I know that we are supposed to move content to the archvie, but I think completing the discussions for each step is more important right now.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> I want to write a story for 44 and Amelia. You see, we play but we don't record it while playing. So afterward there is nothing to remember.
  <msg spk="Tanya">What do you play together?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Predominately escape games.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Was there a storyline? Other than "you've been locked up and need to escape"?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">The last one was "The Pharaoh's tomb". The story was that you were on a tour visiting a tomb, then you got lost and the stone door closes behind you.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Was it memorable?
  <msg spk="Black">It wasn't, but that's the kind of thing we do together.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But was that the most memorable thing you did together recently?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">They liked the Worst Case Scenario Surival Game, which was a trivia game. But we had only started.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That seems easier to write about with less commitment.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> Oh, I remember one thing memorable about the Pharaoh escape game. The instruction kept on hinting that we need to destroy the game material to solve the solve the puzzles. And time and time again I showed that we didn't need to do so. It seemed like a scheme from the game maker to prevent the set from being replayed.
  <msg spk="Sasha">So did you end up destroying it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">No, we kept it good as new.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then can we play it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Yes, but I am trying to write a story for us.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">We are already playing Mice &amp; Mystics. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Why can't we play both?</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> Instead of a story, which would be a lot of commitment, why not start with a reivew or a report? There you could put who played it and your confirmation that the players do not need to destroy the game to solve it.
  <msg spk="Black">Okay, I'll do that first. I think that's a good idea.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> What about the Baker Street Irregular case? When do we resume that?
  <msg spk="Black">Maybe in a few weeks.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Aww...</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think that will be easier to write story for, because the puzzles would not be, "look at these pictures and find the numbers to open a lock."</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">True.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">It might be more difficult, but it is the group dynamic that turns the situation into a story. As long as you have likable characters, it almost doesn't matter what they are doing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think that is too much effort trying to make something good out of something difficult.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> When do we continue Mice &amp; Mystics?
  <msg spk="Sasha">Maybe this weekend?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Hurry up so I can play XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> What about Tanya? Is Tanya happy?
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think there should be better stories than those about playing games. For Cardinal Quests, we using games to tell what we do in reality. If you just start with a game and try to tell the story about it, then it is the oppposite of what Cardinal is about.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> What quests do 44 and Amelia have?
  <msg spk="Black">Their schedules are quite full with kids.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">But I'll keep that in mind that if they ask for something, we will make that a quest.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Then maybe I can also help. ü§ó</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So how does Tanya reward herself?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I hope that we don't pressure each other to talk. This discussion should be voluntary. üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> How about in the next Mice &amp; Mystics tile, I sit out and Tanya plays?
  <msg spk="Tanya">It had only been 30 minutes since Maginos was OOM. I envision him to be OOM for the whole chapter until he gets proper rest--After escaping the castle.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then how about Tanya try playing Collin?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I would rather roleplay Maginos while he is not actually on the game board.</msg>

      <h4>Highlight</h4>
      <div class=""></div>
      The game instruction keeps on telling us that we need to mark, fold, cut and tear the game material to solve the riddles, but it is unnecessary if you could imagine what happens if something is folded or cut. There was nothing hidden out of sight. If you need to mark on something, you could just make a copy and mark on the copy. 
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>The Good</h4>
      <div class=""></div>
      A good thing about this escape game, is that it is completely self-contained. You don't need to go to any website or download any app for the game to work. 
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>The Mechanism</h4>
      <div class=""></div>
      Like other escape games, the many riddles about observing and deducing the pattern intended by the designer. In this game, all solutions are translated into three symbols. When the answer wheel is turned to that symbol pattern, it gives the number of a card, which leads to the verdict on whether the answer is correct.

      <div class="">PART I - Overview</div>
      <hide>
    The Cardinal Engine (aka. Cardinal, Engine) is a set of rules that translate real life attributes, actions, and challenges into game terminologies to turn life into a game in the style a person (the player) chooses. This quest charter requests approval to implement Cardinal to gamify peacemaking according to the design goals below.
      </hide>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <div class="">PART II - Design Goals</div>
      <hide>
        <b>1.  Public Domain Design:</b> The Cardinal Engine and ALL of its module and art assets shall be designated as public domain. (i.e.: The appearance of the Cardinal Logo may resemble, but is not, a copyright sign.)<br><br>

        <b>2.  Translating Real Challenges:</b> The game Engine shall translate real life attributes and challenges so that the thought patterns, skills, and solutions to resolve in-game challenges are equivalent to peacemaking skills in real life. <br><br>
        
        <b>3. Aligned Rewards:</b> In-game rewards shall be aligned to peacemaking efforts. (e.g. A player shall earn EXP only if their action contributes to peacemaking. See also the EPIC categories of peacemaking activities.)<br><br>

        <b>4. Player-Bound EXP:</b> Since player EXP come from peacemaking deeds, the EXP shall follow the player and be importable to any Cardinal game mod. (i.e. A player is allowed to level up in any Cardinal game ,or without playing the game, and be able to import their player EXP to get an equivalent character corresponding to their level in the theme and context of the any Cardinal game. <br><br>

        <b>5. Low Stress Gameplay:</b> While the game provides a platform as a reward for peacemakers to play, with in-game activities not necessarily eligible for earning peacemaker EXP, the Engine shall have mechanism against over-indulgence in the game itself. The stress level created by the game itself shall not be more than that of current events occurringat the time of play.

            2023-09-10: Daggerheart uses two D12, with one representing hope and the other fear. While this creates many variabilities, I think this type of variabilities is too much for our group. <msg spk="Sasha">We shifted away from numbered dice and want a system with less arithmetic and result tables.</msg> Permanent character death seems to be a thing in Daggerheart but that also doesn't work in our group. What I like is the modular card system, where every rule, attribute, backstory element is captured by a card. So building a character is like deck building. When we do it online, the deck can be virtual, and there could be more explanation than what can fit on the card. In our group we don't want a system where there is a deck to maintain for each player. But cards are cute and we could design cards and print them as keepsake.

  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="", you will only find one hit at a YouTube. And that is not us. The quest is to make Arcacianism searchable.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> One of the suggestions was to promote at Twitter. At Twitter, Red mentioned 'Hospitalianism" several times, but google search result only gives one link to Red's account.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> And that link does not directly go to the tweet where Red mentioned it. So Twitter is not good at increasing search visibility UNLESS it gets others talking about it.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> However, I propose we still make a tweet about Arcacianism, and see if the search result will go from 1 hit (with none by us) to 2 hits (with one by us).
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Could we add a link to Arcacianism at Seed of Peace?

        The concept of Gift Economy presented here is not necessarily the same as Gift Society described in . A Gift Economy does not depend on concepts such as RBE. Gift Economy is about an economy based on the intention to give, which requires the giver to be a rightful owner of the thing being given.

  <div class=""><b>Should</b> scavenging from recycling bin (for recyclables) be legal or illegal?
  <msg spk="James">As part of Chapter 28 Chartered objective, the purpose of this thread is to vet common policies and judge whether they support or violate freedom.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>James:</b> Context: A city has a contract with a recylcing company where the recycling company provides recycling bins to the households, and gives the city a refund for the amount of recyclables collected through that arrangement. The refund reduces the collective per household rate for waste removal.
  <div></div><b>James:</b> In that context, there are scavengers who would go from household to household collecting recyclables from those bin, then haul them to the recycling center to get a refund for themselves.
  <div></div><b>James:</b> Question: Should that scavenger practice be LEGAL?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> Depositing recyclables to a marked recycling bin can mean that the depositor wants the city be refunded. But not always, as some households do not care. However, the scavenger has no rights to assume that the households do not care. Scavengers have a responsibility to ask for permission. Otherwise, they are violating the household's freewill.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Black:</b> So this comes down to a communication issue. The moral bottom line is that since there is a process of how the recyclable shall get from the household to the recycling place where the city would be credited, no one shall assume that they have the permission to violate the process. <hl>Assuming permission is a moral violation.</hl>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think this question has merit for @Arena, and Black should join Arena.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If you take the time to list all the moral bottom line, you might have a consistent set of moral rules.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">I'll consider joining as "moralism" then.</msg>

  <msg spk="Casey">Is it true that if we tag it with @Wish then it will be fulfilled?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Oh, and this is what I'm talking about:
  
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> For the record I'm not complaining.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Even though by volume we have more LEGO than boardgames.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">And we didn't do much about the last set that we got and built.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">And in terms of transferability, boardgames are much easier to give away as a set.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">And we don't even have an inventory of LEGOs, but now we do for boardgames.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> , why? XD
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Based on what happened to the pirate ship, if we get this it will just be displayed as a set. We won't be modifying it or playing it, and probably not taking pictures either.
  <msg spk="Sasha">We won't be writing stories about it either. It will just be there, and "we have it."</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Just to be clear. I don't have a problem with that. I am just setting the expectation so people don't feel like they have to do something "make the set worth it". It is not there for any other purpose. It is just there for there sake.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I still want a Magic Bakery LEGO build.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I'm against getting more LEGO. Since... it is plastic.
  <msg spk="Casey">Why would it matter if we won't be throwing it away?</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> These discussions. It tends to take us longer to discuss than the cost of getting them.
  <msg spk="Ivy">Wouldn't it be best if we figure out why this set is special? There are many things and many LEGO sets, but Casey doesn't ask for everything but this. If we figure out why this is special, maybe we could find an alternative that is just as good.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Casey, would you be satisfied if you just have the box? Or just a photo or a miniaturized box?
  <msg spk="Casey">You mean if we just print a photo of it and put it on the desk?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes, or just having a section on the Blog with photos of LEGO sets that you ever thought of getting?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">ü§®</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I have to think about it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">This actually works...? XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Then let's try making such a node. A collection of LEGO set photos.
  <msg spk="Casey">Okay. I'll do that and see what happens by Aug 3rd.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Wait. Then when you say you want to get the set, you don't actually look forward to building it?
  <msg spk="Casey">I guess not.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> And not for the minifigures and special pieces?
  <msg spk="Casey">I guess not. I feel they are not worth the price tag. I don't see myself as a collector and I am not trying to collect things.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then I don't get it. <i>What</i> is it you want from the set?</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>LRRH:</b> Maybe Casey just wants to express the love for LEGO? You don't need to own it to express love.
  <msg spk="Casey">I don't feel very strongly at that explanation. It might be part of it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Sasha feels a little threatened because Casey would let go of the LEGO, then her collection of board games would become the biggest target.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't think we have an agendar to get rid of everything. üòÖ</msg>

    <msg spk="Evelyn">(Tilda): Actually I don't get P4's reason. If the Roach might not reach us in the next turn, why do we attack it first? Why aren't we attacking the one that will attack us for sure? üòÖ</msg>
    <msg spk="Ledia">Because if it comes too slowly, you would run out of targets to attack in the next term. That's DPS logic.</msg>
    <msg spk="Zoey">Aggressive XD</msg>
    <msg spk="Evelyn">But Filch is almost out of HP. Next turn we would probably be attacked by three minions, so that would be Nez, Collin, and Filch. If we had KO'ed one more minion closest to us, Filch might be safe from attacks.</msg>
    <msg spk="Ledia">Aren't you going to heal Filch?</msg>
    <msg spk="Evelyn">I can't use free action in water. üòñ</msg>
    <msg spk="Ledia">But you could use an action to do First Aid. The card say you may use it as a free action. I would interpret that to mean in addition to using it as an action.</msg>
    <msg spk="Cardinal">That would be my interpretation.</msg>
    <msg spk="P4">Now I also have dodge. If something comes at me I can dodge and be out of its range.</msg>
    <msg spk="Evelyn">I think Tilda will do what makes the most sense to her at the moment and attack the Roach closest to the group. (Everyone is out of range for First Aid, unless I use the Heal All scroll, that can heal anyone on the whole tile.) üòñ</msg>
    <msg spk="Zoey">Tilda can't first aid because of the water current XD</msg>

    <msg spk="P4">But I lose a cheese for sure if I dodge.</msg>

  <msg spk="Ledia">But you are posting the card text online.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That's just because it is easier to reference.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">So do I get credits if I post more info as you play?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes, but I think you only get one point per day. Last time StarTree listed all reward cards for Dungeon! and got 2 points over two days.</msg>

          <msg spk="LRRH">Suppose there is a situation where hoarding is causing poverty. What is a solution based on compassion?

        The reply has several fallacies. In my example I showed that <i>competition</i> is a solution type, where a person who didn't get enough would try to go earlier (race) to get what they need. Racing or competiting is not a solution based on compassion. 
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Instead of admitting that there are responses not based on compassion, the tweeter denies that there are other motivations of hoarding (No True Scotsman fallacy).</hide>
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Being proactive and being compassionate are not the same. A selfish person can also be proactive (Black-or-white fallacy).</hide>
        <button class="" To restrict its meaning to avoid admitting that hoarding can be the result of selfishness is moving the goal post (Special Pleading fallacy).</hide>

    <div class=""><b>Black-or-White</b> fallacy tends to group concepts into good or evil categorically without a middle ground or without considerating variation of a concept. Its effects include classifying a good behavior as bad and vice versa.</div>

        If the thinker is unaware of their black-or-white thinking, informing them what it is might be all it takes for them to reconsider. By reconsidering, terms that have collapsed into the same meaning can have their own meaning again. That gives the thinker much more vocabulary to work with, which allows them address finer details in a discussion.

      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        When Black-or-white fallacy is used, the neutral ground can be missing entirely. Take the following for example:
        <div class="">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Evil</h4>
            <hr>
            Malice
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Neutral</h4>
            <hr>
            Apathy
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Good</h4>
            <hr>
            Compassion
          </div>
          <div class="spacer"></div><div class="spacer"></div>
        </div>
        Black-or-white fallacy may eliminate the neutral ground. In the example above, the thinker would need to classify Apathy as either evil or good, which gives two possible results.
        <div class="">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Black-or-White</h4>
            <h4>Apathy is Evil</h4>
            <hr>
            "If you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem."
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Logically Correct</h4>
            <h4>Apathy is Neutral</h4>
            <hr>
            "People who are apathetic are neither showing malice nor compassion."
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Black-or-White</h4>
            <h4>Apathy is Good</h4>
            <hr>
            "A person who does not help people in need is still a compassionate person."

      <div class="">Effect 2: Missing Mixed Categories</div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        The effect of Black-or-white fallacy can permeate among the concepts that the thinker has put in the same category. For example, a thinker who considers lawful actions are good and compassionate actions are good, may then conclude by composition fallacy that all lawful acts are compassionate acts.

            <s>c) unlawful but compassionate;</s><br>

        Cherry-picking can be caused by confirmation bias, where a person looks for examples to support instead of to evaluate their argument. In doing so, they may unintentionally ignore counter examples to their argument. A truth-seeking person will reevaluate their conclusion when they are .

            Counter evidences have little use to followers because without the means to process them, they may create more cognitive dissonace than excitment.

A safer path is to first identify the personal situation that they need help with, and propose an alternative solution based on correct logic.

          "[1] Profit demands inefficiency. [2] Volunteerism demands efficiency. [3] If a continuing problem makes money, there's no incentive to solve the problem. [4] If a continuing problem requires unremunerated effort to solve, it will be solved as fast as possible."

          <div class="">üçí Relation between Profit and Efficiency</div>
          <hide><hr>
            <div class=""></div>
            By definition, profit is the difference between a person's reward minus their effort. Inefficiency happens when the effort/reward ratio is high. 
            <div class="">
              <h4>Case 1: A lone Individual</h4>
              When a person is alone, the more efficient they are, the more profit they can make (from their effort). When a person is alone, a "problem" that allows them to "profit" is not a problem but an asset. [1] is nonsense when we consider an individual by themself.
            </div>
            <div class="">
              <h4>Case 2: A seller and a buyer</h4>
              When a person (seller) is making a profit off someone else (a buyer), the seller has an incentive to prolong the problem (to make profit), while the buyer has an incentive to end the problem (to keep their profit). [1] ignores the for-profit buyer who still has an incentive to be efficient. That is Cherry-Picking.<br>
            </div>  
            <div class="">
              <h4>Case 3: Multiple sellers and multiple buyers</h4>
              For-profit buyers have incentive to keep their profits by being efficent with what they can control. When given multiple sellers, a for-profit buyer chooses the lower price to retain their profit. Since inefficient sellers cannot offer lower prices, the buyers being able to choose different sellers drive the sellers to be more efficient. This dynamic exposes a seller's inefficient by comparing them against their competitors.<br>
            </div>              
            <div class="">
              <h4>Case 4: Profiting off negative externalities</h4>
              Profiting off negative externarlities here means a sellor off loading waste products to someone else (a victim) without their consent. This behavior can increase profit because the seller is not putting the effort to handle the waste properly. The incentive to not handle waste product is present even without trade. (e.g. A person may decide to let trash pile up in their own room without affecting other people.)
            </div>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            In conclusion, profit does not demand inefficiency. There are conditions in whcih a for-profit interaction of increases efficiency, and conditions where efficiency can decrease. To ignore the other possibility to say "Profit demands inefficiency" is cherry-picking.

            Voluntarism by definition includes all types of motivations. A person's willingless to be efficient depends on their source of motivation. The concept "Voluntarism demands efficiency" can be disproved by counter examples based on different motivations:

            <b>Step 1:</b> Go to this  to get the 300px display on your browser. Highlight it, then click on another window so that the highlight changes from blue to grey.<br>
            <b>Step 2:</b> Screen capture the emoji with the grey background color. Crop it as needed.<br>
            <b>Step 3:</b> Copy the image to PowerPoint. Shrink to <b>8%</b>. Adjust the color as needed. Set the grey background transparent. Add a custom non-trasparent black glow of 2 pt. Add a centered shadow. If the black border is not dark enough, copy the icon and overlay it with itself.<br>
            <b>Step 4:</b> When the icon is ready, center it inside a transparent square and group them to fix the offset.<br>
            üìå <b></b>(Step 5:) This is the result that should be uploaded to GitHub, and shown in a node, so that when we or someone else may find and reuse them easily when making new cards.

      <h4>Story</h4>
      It was LEGO's 90th Anniversary. Some of us really want the new castle. Meanwhile, I want a LEGO model of Magic Bakery. Instead of making a separate wish node for each LEGO thing we want, I thought maybe they could all be at the same wish node.

    <div class="">
      <div class=""></div>
      <h4>Challenge</h4>
      Get rid of one crate worth of stuff before building the castle.

  <div class=""><b>So</b> I'm going to draw the Ageless Forest Arena. There is a quest on adding notes on how to draw. But I don't know what notes should be there. Could you help me by asking questions?
  <msg spk="3B">You can see the art quest by clicking the parent link.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I want to learn how to draw. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">I can show you what I do, I don't really have advices...</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think we need to make a quest node for the drawing of the Arena Stage.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If it is not urgent we can just make the node later based on what we talk about here.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">@StarTree, could you make a node now?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">What template should it use?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's make a template from Treasure and call it Asset</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Roger!</msg>
  <lnk>202208042023|‚≠ê Arena Stage </lnk>

  <msg spk="Zoey">StarTree you are spoiling Tanya! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree got credit! ‚≠ê</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> Previously, we discussed a little bit with Fina on what and where the stage should be. She wanted to see the Gate Temple entrance in the background. But Evelyn worried that it would block the way to the temple. So I made a design to feature a Gate Temple style gate in the background in a more secluded location. It is a side door to the temple.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I like this picture. It seems like a quiet place where I would want to wait to meet up with the party for a quest. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">It think it is too small. The Arena is supposed to have spectators, and judges.</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">I was thinking maybe we should start small and figure out everything we need and how an Arena fight works before designing a better stage.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Okay.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> What is the shape of the stage?
  <msg spk="3B">In that picture is a rectangle with rounded ends. Like the shape of a running track, but the ends are not fully rounded into semi circles.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The two Pillars in the foreground should be further out so they don't block the view of the stage.</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">Good point. In fact that was an error in perspective. They should be further out to line up with the pillars in the background.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">How big is the stage? What is the size of a person in that drawing?</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">A person is just a little shorter than the height of a pillar. So even if you are standing, you could reach the top of the pillar and climb up.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> What is the purpose of the pillars?
  <msg spk="3B">Maybe they mark the boundary of a barrier, so that attacks from the stage don't affect the outside.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But they are outside the stage.</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">Right. That allows a person to be out of bound of the stage without reaching the barrier.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I suggest that the pillars to look like elemental totems. When they are active, you can see glowing symbols.
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like that idea.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Could we make it so that it shows the symbol or color of the champion? So instead of having a fixed element for each totem, the totem just shows the element it is activated with?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like that idea too.</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">Hmm... So we need to design symbols for the elements.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I added that as a side quest. The main quest being: "define and draw the stage."</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> So is the size about okay?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is still diffifcult for me to tell how big the stage is from the picture. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">How big do you want it to be?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Maybe the size of a beach volleyball court, but not as long?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It says a beach volleyball court is 60' by 30'.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I never realized that it is a square on each side. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">60' by 30' is 12 by 6 tiles in D&amp;D scale. It is just slightly too long to print on printer paper.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">If you ever want to play the stage D&amp;D style with minatures.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">What about a stage that is 8 tiles by 6 tiles</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Why not make it 8 by 8 like a chessboard? Then you can play chess on it. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">8 by 8 means 40 feet wide right? That's huge. You can't see what is going on.</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">I think 40 by 40 feet is probably not too big. If you have wings and spread them, you could easily be 10 feet wide.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">How about 10 tiles by 8 tiles, 50 feet by 40 feet, with rounded corners beyond the 40 feet square. I drew it in Powerpoint.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Could we have odd number of tiles for width and length? So that there is a center tile?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I drew 11 by 7 and 9 by 5. Since we don't care about 8x8, I made the corner radius to be 2 tiles.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think they both look better than 10 by 8.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think 11 by 7 looks more like an arena. 9 by 5 looks like a practice area.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I'm okay with the secluded scene be the practice area. Let's start small.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I added the approximate location of the totems.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I have an idea. Why don't we build a LEGO model of it so we can see the size?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">What would be the size of a tile for LEGO people?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">6 by 6.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Do you have 45 6x6 tiles around?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">No, but if you use microfigure, a tile is about a 2x2.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">What is a microfigure?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">The ones they use in LEGO board games.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">There are more LEGO in the closest XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Sasha is not complaining.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Then the entire stage is a 18 x 10 studs.</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">Let's build it and take a picture. Then we trace it for the drawing.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Helping Maggie is an optional plot with the reward of an achievement that could help in later chapter. But before the heroes could help Maggie, they must first clear the current tunnel. We now roll for the turn order.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Cardinal:</b> Centipede &gt; Nez &gt; Filch &gt; Collin &gt; Tilda. Collin gets one cheese.</hide>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">The party item Disguise has applied to remove two Rat Warriors that would have spawned.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">The Treachery card is applied to place the centipede adjacent to the heroes.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Cardinal:</b> The Centipede attacks first. (Centipede attacks Nez): Sword, Cheese X. üï∞Ô∏è 2:50 / 6:00.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> (Nez defense): Cheese, X.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> The party's urge to help Maggie was stopped short when a towering centipede eruppted from the ground and attacks the biggest mouse it sensed.
  <mbdmg>Nez takes 1 damage.</mbdmg>
  <msg spk="Casey">If I understand correctly, since there is only one minion, it will only attack me every turn, right?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Yes
  <msg spk="Casey">So does it make sense if I get the helmet leather armor also?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">In terms of game mechanics it does, but not for the story.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Maybe Tilda could give Nez her armor in the form of a blessing? So I would give Nez my card, but we don't say that in the story.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I'm okay with that.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> Anyway I'm attacking first. (Nez attack: Sword, Sword, Cheese X.)</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Cardinal:</b> (Centipede defense: Shield, X)</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚öîÔ∏è</div><b>Casey:</b> The Centipede hit Nez so hard that a normal mouse would have flied across the tunnel and fainted. But Nez was not a normal mouse. He grabbed the jaw of the centipede and started wrestling it onto the ground. The two are locked together, dealing blows to each other.
  <msg spk="Casey">Can I level up Nez with Battle Squeak?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Anyone has an ability that can reduce defense? I think We don't want it to roll cheese.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I don't have any debuff. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then I think I should get Battle Leader. It will allow me to switch initiative with Nez. So Nez should give me his helmet and cheese instead.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Okay. I give Collin my helmet and cheese.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> What should I attack with? Dagger, Accurate Bow, or Long Bow?</hide>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Your dagger DPS is 1. Accurate Bow is 1.5. Long bow is 1.33. The long bow could give you the most cheese.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> I want to try the long bow. If I get enough cheese maybe I will attack against with Energy Rush. (Filch attacks with Long Bow: Cheese, X, X, X). I use Energy Rush to attack again.</hide>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Please don't. I won't have enough to get and use Battle Leader.</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">Okay. Then I gave Collin all my cheese.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">P4 roll for kindness please.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Cardinal is making it harder XD</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">(Filch kindness: X)</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Filch will not share cheese this time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But when it is my turn I can still take Filch's cheese right?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">That will take another roll by Filch.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">That will totally mess up our strategy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">In what condition can Filch level up on his kindness? Right now his cooperation is Rank B.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Nothing stood out to me yet from the story. Please think about it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <msg spk="P4">I think my turn is done.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I want to get cheese from P4.</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">(Filch kindness: Success)</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Okay. So It says I can I use Battle Leader immediately after my turn. I take that to mean I can still use an ability during my turn. Any objection?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">No objection.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then my plan is I use Give Order to have Nez attack again because he has a better chance of KO'ing the Centipede. Then I attack. After that I use Battle Order and switch with Nez. Then Nez can attack the third time before it is Tilda's turn.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it is less risky if you attack first and decide whether to use Give Order based on whether you get more cheese. I think it is more important to make sure you have enough cheese to switch the order. If the Centipede attack Nez again it would KO him. You will lose a whole hour. Your chance of getting cheese is only 0.5 with three dice.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay I listen to Tanya and attack first. (Collin attack: Sword, Cheese, Cheese).</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Cardinal:</b> (Centipede defense: Shield, X).</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> As Tilda scrambles in her medicine bag to for herbs to treat Nez, the Centipede lets out an annoyed squeak and retreats back to where it came from.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Cardinal:</b> With the centipede gone, it was aparent that the Rat Warriors spotted Filch. The narrow tunnel didn't give much opportunity for hiding.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> For a moment Collin was worried about Filch but his worry was short-lived as Filch KO's the Rat Warrior before he could intercept. In the dark tunnel it was not obvious that Filch was wounded from the fight.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I search. since I have the Thimble Helm. (Search: Success). I got Levitate Scroll. I guess that's for Maginos.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> I dash and attack the other Rat Warrior. (Move: 2) (Attack: Sword, Cheese)</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Cardinal:</b> (Rat Warrior #2 defense: Cheese). The time is still üï∞Ô∏è 3:00 / 6:00. Filch takes the cheese from the Rat Warrior.</hide>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Perfect timing. XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚öîÔ∏è</div><b>P4:</b> Filch dashes forward and KO's the second Rat Warrior. The tunnel was clear, there was nothing stopping him from leaving the group behind.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> If we help Maggie, we have to return to this tile, right? So I think we should hurry. I'll search then Tilda should go up. (Search:Success) I got Cheese Cache. That is one cheese for Tilda and Nez. (Move: 3) I move to the ladder.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Nez gets to the ladder. He is going up, as a matter of course.
  <div></div><div class=""

  <msg spk="Sasha">Might as well, and try finding a knife for Filch.</msg>

  <msg spk="P4">I walk to Tilda's space and use search. (Search: Success). I use Find. I got Clawbitter, Lucky Staff, and Tinkerer's Treasure.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">There we go.</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">So I give the Tinkerer's Treasure to Nez, and Nez gives me a knife?</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">If you choose to do that let's just say Filch found a knife from the KO'ed Rat Warrior.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Which knife do you want, big shot? We've got Dagger, Slicing Dagger, and Throwing Daggers.</msg>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> I think the normal Dagger is the strongest. (Filch gets a second dagger.)</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Is this only for those who are paladins as main class?
  <msg spk="Natalie">It is for paladins of any level. If you want to help in case of a physical conflict, then you are a paladin.</msg>

  <msg spk="Ledia">The protect skill that you use all the time is a paladin skill.</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">You may introduce yourself as a cleric on the roster! ü§ó</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">I'm a Herald, I guess that's real. XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>P4:</b> P4 signed up. üíü
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> It's about time.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think it would be more fun if there is a game component of this.
  <msg spk="Natalie">What do you have in mind?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Maybe mock situation where help is needed, then a team is dispatched and we can see how paladin skills work.</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">I can't think of any existing game like that.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Detective games are more about investigation, not action. On the other extreme are war games. There is a void in between of games about paladin
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think the normal adventurer theme is quite close to it.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Natalie:</b> How about we start by identifying situations where it is relevant for paladins to intervene?
  <msg spk="V">Russia has been invading Ukraine since February.</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">That is within what paladins should be trained to respond.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Then what is our role? If we are not taking a plane to and fight in the war zone? And is that the proper response of paladins?</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">If the paladins have a strong upper hand, the paladins would smite the invader. Which generally means the invaders would not have tried in the first place.</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">If there is not such overwhelming force, then the rest of the world is try to influence the attacker to give up using sanction and other pressures.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think the concept of avoiding mutual annihilation is relevant here. Russia has nuclear warheads.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I see some kind of dillemma: On one hand, the world could be more peaceful if paladin has such overwhelming force against evil. On the other hand, it is unrealistic that any faction or nation could be the only one with such overwhelming power. Given the norm that no nation would have such overwhelming power, when would paladins be able to help the way it is intended?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think that is a basic military strategy question. A small army can defeat a big army in many ways.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But you can't assume that the invader doesn't also have a good strategist.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If you recognize that both sides are equal in everyway then there is indeed no advantage but luck. In that case, it is a race to find the advantage to tip the balance. That is very much in the realm of Oracles. As Paladins, the emphasis is on preparing and maintaining a physical edge against evil.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think in general the good side is more creative and accepting so they can find the edge that the evil side cannot when it is governed through lies.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I think I am good with that answer for now. But we need something to log this. I think this can turn into something more concrete. I'm tagging it for detective for now. But I want to focus on promoting Arcacianism.</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">I'll follow up as I restructure Ask a Paladin. üôÇ</msg>

  <div class=""><b>I</b> don't know where this should go, but it is somewhat interesting. So here it goes.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> I noticed this back in April. Normally when I strip wire using a wire cutter that as a grove, I would hold the wire in my left hand, the wire cutter in my right hand. I clamp the cutter around the wire then push the cutter away from myself.
  <msg spk="Black">That's the way I have always been doing.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> But P4 did it differently. She holds the wire in her left hand, but very close to the end, such that when she clamps the wire, she can push the wire off from the cutter toward herself.
  <msg spk="Black">The main benefit of her way is that the insulation just falls down without any drama.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I would say P4's way is the correct way. You've been doing it wrong all these years XD
  <msg spk="Black">Most likely.</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">üíü</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> While we are at it, I might as well mention something else that P4 does.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> Sometimes we need to thread multiple wires through a small opening. What I would normally do, was to tape the wires together and thread it through at once.
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> What P4 does, is that she uses the loose label tube that is already on the wire. She stuffs the end of the next wire in that tube. by doing so the tube becomes tight. Then she stuffs the third wire into the label of the second wire, and so on, forming a train of wires with its end inside the tube of the wire in front. Then she threads it through.
  <msg spk="Black">Sometimes the wire train comes loose, but overall it is faster than using tape.</msg>
  <msg spk="P4">üíü</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> P4 is really good at this. She is patient and focused.
  <mbrec>P4 is recognized for being patient and focused.</mbrec>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> And efficient.
  <mbrec>P4 is recognized for being efficient.</mbrec>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Inconspicuous.
  <msg spk="Black">Yes, all those dexterity skills are hard to notice because she is not using anything extra and it was done without big movements.</msg>
  <mbrec>P4 is recognized for being inconspicuous.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="Black">She flies there and flies back. And it is done.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Dependable.</msg>

        ‚≠ê <div class=""></div> 2022-08-10: I worried that the bakery is too tall compared to other buildings. So we checked against the Tavern from Medieval Market Village. It was not too tall, in fact its floors were one brick too short. It might be a little too wide however.

  <div class=""><b>So</b> we started building Magic Bakery with LEGO, and the Castle arrived.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> And I am thinking of returning the castle.
  <msg spk="Casey">Oh why?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">I think that if we keep the club going, building the Magic Bakery would probably be more useful. So we aren't really in a hurry to start with the castle.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">But then why return it? We could just keep it until we build it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Because when we got the castle, we didn't get any VIP add-on. So I thought we could just wait and see if there is a good add-on or whether building our own original builds is all we really want to do as a club.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">And there is at least a pirate add-on right now. I can't order another castle until I return this castle.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">I don't approve that practice of returning a purchase and buying it again just for the gifts.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">My argument supporting that is, if you don't do that, LEGO won't learn to make their gift policy more friendly.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That's a stretch because we can fairly assume that LEGO knew that its gift policy is working in making people buy more LEGO.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">I don't really have a strong argument.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think the focus should be the castle, not the gifts. Are you saying that you don't care if the castle becomes sold out?
  <msg spk="Black">I don't think it will sell out just yet.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Do you mean if you return it, you would constantly check for new gifts an buy it when there is a good gift? And what is a good gift?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">There is no good gift. You can buy every piece separately. But I agree with returning it, since there is a chance that we don't end up getting it at all.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> May I know more about why Ivy is against the castle?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I am against LEGO in general. It is an expensive hobby especially if you buy new sets. Even if you don't buy new sets, it takes up a lot of space. I am also against it because it is not a hobby we can readily recommend or promote. It is too commercial, and it is plastic. On the other hand I could promote drawing because it is free and doesn't take much space.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Some information about whether LEGO can be 
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Little Red Riding Hood thinks that the LEGO town should have a castle, but it doesn't have to be the Lion Knights' Castle.
  <msg spk="Tanya">If we have to build a castle, I hope we build a Hospitalian Knights castle.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">They don't make the exact pieces you need to build a Hospitalian Knights caslte. The only thing that can really satisfy unbounded possibilities is drawing. That's the best way to get something exact.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> I think the LEGO builds can help explain concepts and help our website.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it will help somewhat. If you actually use it for relevant topics. But it being useful shouldn't be a requirement for keeping LEGO.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Anyway. I think that if you spend the last hour building with LEGO every day, and all the rest of the day shopping or discussing about LEGO, then the Guild is practically dead
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think it should be fine if don't talk about it until the last hour? The bakery that is being build does look quite cute. I want to see it completed. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> How about unless three non-rank A chartered tasks are completed, there is no LEGO building for the night?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think that is reasonable. We were able to do that on average last month.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">This guild is not about authority, so I'm posing it as a challenge. I'm challenging the LEGO Club to keep up with the same level of guild activity so that there is no doubt on whether the club is distracting the purpose of the guild.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> I can accept not talk about LEGO during the day, but the last hour should be just free. I don't feel like I am doing anything less than before.
  <msg spk="Ivy">But you are still using guild space and having an effect on what the guild is about.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">But your guild score is lower than mine... I mean... shouldn't it matter only if someone with higher score complain?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Casey, that's not a good thing to say... I think Everyone's opinion is important because we are not completing for power. That's not what the score is for. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I'm sorry. I apologize.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">For the record, at the moment Casey is ranked 10th in the guild with 1292 points. Ivy is ranked 15th with 827 points!</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think Ivy's score is lower than what it should be because she doesn't always log when she does something for the guild.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Is that true, Ivy? Are you not logging when you should get a point?
  <msg spk="Ivy">That's not true. I just spend most of my time doing my own stuff. I am not asking for more points to be awarded to me. I think the scoring is fair for me and for Casey. And I disagree with Evelyn. I think when it comes to limited resources, this is what the point system IS for.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Side note: Ivy was the main original designer of the point system and Quest Society!</msg>
  <mbaa>Ivy receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Does it mean... Casey needs to bid?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I'm not asking for a bid because I am not using the guild space. I already have a lab. But if someone else want to use the same guild space, bidding would be an option to resolve the conflict.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I've just taken a photo.</msg>
  
  <msg spk="Zoey">It is us as LEGO people discussing in front of the LEGO Magic Bakery! XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If we start making more LEGO things, this is the kind of photo we could include in every post. You can't have 3B draw this because drawing is not immediate. Taking a photo is immediate.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Maybe we should also have a Photography club XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think I am good with being part of LEGO Club for now.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">You should still make a node just for Photography settings, even if it is not a full club.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> We have about 40 minutes remaining, could we update three charter quests?
  <msg spk="Casey">I added LEGO Magic Bakery to @Treasure. That should count as an update.</msg>
  <mbcomplete>@Treasure has been updated!</mbcomplete>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I want to recognize Ivy for the skill Challenge. @Skill is already at Rank A for this month so it doesn't count toward the daily challenge for the LEGO Club.</msg>
  <mbrec>Ivy is now recognized for the Magician Skill Challenge.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I updated @Book there is a lot of work to do there. üòÖ</msg>
  <mbcomplete>@Book has been updated!</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> For @Dungeon, I'm expanding the scope to add cognitive bias. I think I used to be overly negative. So I am adding negativity first. Being with the guild has taught me that when people come together and share their goals, something that appeared to be negative to me at first could actually be beneficial in ways I could not foresee. But the cooperation makes it possible.

  <mbcomplete>@Dungeon has been updated!</mbcomplete>
  <mbcomplete>Ivy's challenge to the LEGO Club is completed for tonight!</mbcomplete>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I like this challenge! üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">@StarTree, timestamp please.</msg>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [10:46 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <msg spk="Casey">So... can we start talking about LEGO now? since we completed the challenge?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Yes you may. You don't have to wait until the last hour before you start talking about LEGO.</msg>
  <msg spk="ivy">I might also add that the purpose of the challenge is to orient the guild to focus on charter activities. I'm okay with you setting up a scene while doing charter activities at the same time.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Okay, I'll make sure that the updates are meaningful and substantial.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That's part of the non-rank A requirement.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> What happens when all charters are already Rank A for the month?
  <msg spk="Ivy">By the current Magic Bakery standard, you could just play your hearts out when all charters are already rank A.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Holy moly! For real?!</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That's how I would interpreted it. But please don't over do it. Bedtime is still in effect.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">LEGO Marathon XD</msg>
  <hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Okay. so let's keep building the LEGO Magic Bakery. Actually we have a lot to talk about for the Bakery and for the club. But let's focus on the bakery first. If you have ideas, please write it down on paper notes, since in the last hour we don't look at screens.

  <div class=""><b>As</b> suggested, I started the photography club to document the settings we use for taking photos for the guild blog. 
  <msg spk="Tanya">The purpose of the club is not to review or get new cameras.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> The process of taking a photo then uploading for the blog is not streamlined. I think there are much room for improvement. But one thing I want to discuss is the style of displaying the photo on the blog.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In the old LEGO book, photos had a soft edge. If we want to keep the similar style, It means that there is a step to apply soft edge in PowerPoint, then re-saving the image before uploading to Github.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I tried checking if HTML/JS can do soft edge, but it seems that it cannot.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So. Should we keep the same style?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Could you post the same photo without soft edge but with rounded corners?
  <msg spk="Tanya">@StarTree.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Done!</msg>
  
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think soft edge with rounded corners look better than just soft edge or just rounded corner.
<msg spk="Tanya">If you can only pick one which would you rather see?</msg>
<msg spk="LRRH">Soft edge.</msg>
<msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> StarTree, could you show the photo in the usual brown border with corner radius of 10px?
<msg spk="StarTree">Done!</msg>

<div></div><b>Vivi:</b> Why is there seem to be an additional white border insdie the brown frame?
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree doesn't know!

<div></div><b>StarTree:</b> It is part of Border!
<div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> Could you try no border, but with box shadow, and corner radius 15px?

<msg spk="Black">I think this looks pretty good.</msg>
<msg spk="LRRH">I thinks this is good. Maybe better than soft edge.</msg>
<msg spk="StarTree">For your comparison!</msg>


<msg spk="Black">Round corner with shadow looks the best here.</msg>
<div></div><div class="".

  <msg spk="Black">I haven't decided whether I would return it yet. But opening the package shouldn't be a problem.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Just for the record, who is for or against keeping the set?
  <msg spk="Ivy">I am against keeping because it takes space, and I think it is something we need to undo later on.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">What do you mean by undo?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">You would eventually want not to promote peace using commercial plastic products when there is a clearly more eco-friendly and free alternative of using digital drawings.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">It poses a contradiction. It is an addiction issue to resolve.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">So you are saying that if we want something 3D, we could use wood, cray or paper, but not LEGO blocks.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">Yes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> What about LEGO build using old LEGO bricks?
  <msg spk="Ivy">That still promotes more new bricks unless you literally saves the bricks from being discarded.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> The set we got is the castle.
  <msg spk="Black">And I don't really have an argument against Ivy's.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Then what do we do about the castle set? It already exist. If we return it, we are wasting shipping effort.</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Maybe it means that should be the last set, and you may only build it if you use it against the hobby.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That is kind of mean.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Wait, wouldn't that also apply to board games with plastic parts?
  <msg spk="Ivy">Yes it would.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Okay. I'm in favor of keeping it. But we won't start building it until we let go of enough stuff to make room for it.
  <msg spk="Casey">Does that include getting rid of stuff in the garage? We have an extra refrigerator there. It won't really save us any space inside the house.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">You should find a way to get rid of the extra refrigerator, and make room inside the house.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Don't we have space in the display case? One section is still empty since we last tidied it.
  <msg spk="Casey">We just put the picture frames in a crate. They are still inside a crate.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> My challenge is to get rid of one crate worth of stuff inside the house before we would build the castle.
  <msg spk="Casey">I'll take that challenge. I think it is fair. Does it include rearranging things to make room of one crate, or do we have to actually get rid of one craft of stuff.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">I would say get rid of. If you just rearrange stuff, the mass is still the same.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">But why would you want to get rid of things if they could be useful?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">I think we can find things that are not useful. I think we should try first, and evaluate if we really can't do it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">Alright.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">So can we get rid of board games?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">You may get rid of the Murder Mystery board games after scanning them. You may also get rid of the VR escape room game and Tips Ahoy, which we played.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> I think we could also get rid of binders and stacks of printer papers. I don't think we have that much to print, if we will prefer the digital alternatives. I think we have two crates worth of paper and binders.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Please get rid of the murder mystery games after scanning them first. It is hard to play them unless they are scanned.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">The real reason Sasha offer them to be removed XD</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> In fact I would propose a challenge that Red shouldn't reply until there is a node with such content.
  <msg spk="Tanya">That is one way to prevent discussion backlog from growing and keep our focus on building the blog in a way that can be referred.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Little Red Riding Hood accepts that pacing.
  <msg spk="LRRH">There are actually two discussions going on.</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> First there is this : "Under a Resource Based Economy, which is what my policies are headed towards, there would be no nation states, because the thing that enables RBE is: Declaring the resources of the world as a common heritage to ALL of Humanity, not just one person, or city, or business."
  <msg spk="LRRH">Before that, I discovered that their "8 philosophical pillars of peace and harmony" did not include autonomy. So I was questioning their stance on freedom of association.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Before you reply, we need a node for taking notes for their philosophy. @StarTree.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Done!</msg>

  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> And what are you comparing it with? Hospitalianism or Stewardism?
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think I can do either. Autonomy is common to both.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then let's bring up the Autonomy node. A reply you make should have reference to a concept on that node.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">That's the minimum. At the minimum, your reply should be based on a concept that is declared.</msg>

  <msg spk="Tanya">I agree.</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">Where should it go? It doesn't fit the definition of Challenges or Contests.</msg>

            The Interstellar New Deal is evolutionary, technocratic, radically progressive, humanistic, sustainable, and is powerfully driven by a vision for a finally peaceful and space-faring Humanity whose eco-humanist ideals will result in the radical transformation of Humanity to evolve beyond poverty, war, and suffering.

          <h4>Definition</h4>
          Stewardism as a moral view is the belief that protecting and sharing the world now and in the future is a moral good. To this end, Stewardism supports concepts such as sustainable living, individual autonomy, and reciprocation. Stewardism recognizes self care, natural wonders, and reciprocation as basic rights.
          <div style="float:right"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Right to Self Care</h4>
          Right to Self Care includes the right to self-defense and take care of oneself. This right includes a person's right to have possession and dwelling for self-care, to call for help, and to appoint their own assistant. Violations to this right include banning people from practicing medicine without a license, and providing false information or credential when offering help. This right is incompatible with subjugation/servitude/slavery contracts: even if a contract of slavery was voluntarily signed, the contract cannot be enforced and an enforcer of such contract is regarded as an aggressor.
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Right to Natural Wonders</h4>
          Right to Natural Wonders maintains the world as a shared place to allow exploration and appreciation of the open world. This right does not include intruding personal dwellings. Violations to this right include pollution and concealment of a wonder.
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Right to Reciprocate</h4>
          Right to Reciprocate means everyone has a right to reciprocate against those violating the rights of others. For example, a polluter of a region could lose their right to enter the region. People who violate others' right to self-care may be kept from having possessions and dwelling in a community. Violations to this right include laws that outlaw reciprocation.
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Property vs Custody</h4>
          The Right to Worldly Wonders aims to keep the world open for every responsible person to enjoy. With this comes the question of "Where may I build my house and how big of a house may I build?"<br>
    
          Judging whether a location is a matter of property or custody is the first step in determining whether and what type of dwelling can be built at a location. In general, abundance and having a sustainable live style make a location eligible to be possessed as personal property, while wonder and importance make a location a matter of shared custody.<br>
    
          At scenic environments, a resort type dwelling would be built to allow different travellers to enjoy. Personal dwellings would be awarded to local caretakers, aka the Stewards.<br>
    
          Stewardism awards contested living spaces to those with the most positive impact in taking care of the locale.<br>
    
          In Stewardism, a Steward is a person who takes care of a locale and maintains positive impact to the environment. They are the people who keep the location clean and ecologically sustainable. A Steward is not referring to a "proprietary owner" but to a person doing the actual maintenance work such as a janitor. By their maintenance work, the locale is kept sustainable for others to enjoy. Their work offsets the negative impact of others to the environment and make the locale affordable for them to visit. Therefore, Stewards are awarded the highest priority when a dwelling space is eligible for personal possession.<br>
    
          The amount of dwelling a person may possess is limited by the amount required for people to exercise their self-care. No one may own extra land when others don't have essential land for their self-care.<br>

          <div class="">Net Migration Rate</div>
          <hide><hr><div class=""></div>
            In the context of international disputes, hospitality can be measured based on net migration rate (NMR) when people voluntarily decide to join a country they prefer. Countries that treat its citizens well tends to retain its population and attracts immigrantion and have positive NMR. Countries that treat its citizens poorly create emigration, giving them negative NMR. Disputed natural resources are awarded to countries with positive NMR.

            The world is self-organized into zones with a connected free zone. Each non free zone may set its own weapon laws. A zone may expel but not detain a person. A zone loses/gains resource from the free zone as it expels/accepts members.

            Country A and B are neighbors and have a dispute over the control of a piece of land X.<br>
          If Country A and B have similar NMR, X would be split between them. If more people are migrating from A to B than from B to A, then B would be awarded the control of X.

          <hide><hr><div class=""></div>
            In Popularism, a country that has a higher population would be allowed to dissolve a country with low population even if the lowly populated country is NMR+. In Hospitalianism, a country does not lose its natural resources unless it is NMR-.

          <div class="">Q: In Hospitalianism, can an NMR+ country take resource from an NMR- country?</div>
          <hide><hr><div class=""></div>
            In Hospitalianism, countries that are NMR- have a duty to yield resources for those who choose to emigrate. The accounting is the same as if those people declare independence from their mother country. If the mother country does not yield the corresponding resource, the mother country is considered a rogue state--an immoral body of government. Once the mother country had yield the corresponding resource, it should become an NMR0 country, not an NMR- country. Therefore, in Hospitalian terminology, an NMR+ country does not take resource from an NMR- country, but an NMR- country is immorally withholding resources that belong to its emigrants. The emigrants have a moral right to retrieve their shares of the resources.

        While a Quest Giver can be a single sponsor, in a Quest Society, a typical Quest Giver is a Guild, which consists of members dedicated to a common goal. Guilds can self-organize and form alliance that recognize credits earned at member guilds.

        A common deliverable object of an exploration quest is a report. According to quest making principles of quest society, the entire space to be explored would be conceptualized and enumerated as soloable sections. A quester gets credit when they produce the report for their chosen section. Once that report is in place, another quester may get credits for verifying the report, or providing updates on an old report if the properties of that area has changed.

            <b>Quests</b> are optional opportunities to earn credits for good deeds. 
            <msg spk="Ivy">The choice of word "Quest" comes from  the free-spirit on helping others as a "side quest" in adventure roleplaying games. In that spirit, quests are not mandatory. The game designer makes the quests not-mandatory by maintaining alternative ways for the player get what they need to stay in the game world. Translated to the real world, it implies that the world has enough open access areas for each person to directly harvest resources and provide for themselves without helping anyeone else, as long as their self-care does not violate the opportunities of others to care for themselves. </msg>

                Taskrabbit is a platform that pairs people who need work done with independent service persons. Compared to Quest Society, Taskrabbit assumes that the person requesting the service will pay. Quest Society in general does not require the quest giver to pay for the service, because the services being requested are public good services. In fact the spotter of an issue would get credits for creating the quest.

                HonorPay is a platform for people to request free service. Compared to Quest Society, HonorPay does not keep track of an quantitative honor and honor is not tied to something functional. In Quest Society, the quest credits have a function in settling scarcity contests.

            <button class=""></div></button><hide>
            <b>Ivy:</b> helping on unplanned incidents are generally worth more credits compared to lower priority quests, so that it makes sense for a capable helper to pause their current quest and handle the higher priority quest first. For this reason, the number of crime fighters overwhelm the number of criminals.

              <b>Ivy:</b> Quest society is unmistakenly anti-public service unions in the sense that by turning public service tasks into public quests, anyone can train themself or get training to do quests and get credits. There is no union that can ban an individual from earning credits.

              <b>Ivy:</b> By completing a quest, the helper is eligible for free material reimbursement and credits but only if the helper is not paid in other ways. This is because free reimbursement and credit represent society's debt to the helper. If the helper is already paid, society assumes no debt.

              <b>Ivy:</b> A helper may not donate or give their credits to another person. The credits is part of the helper's bio. It is assigned to and stays with the individual, and never to an organization. By doing this, an organization cannot hold a help hostage as a subcontractor. It is illegal to falsify who performed the good deed.

            <button class=""></div></button><hide>
              <b>Ivy:</b> Quest Society prioritizes help to helpers, but does not discriminate against helpers or difference races, gender orientation, etc (equality classes) in distributing reimbursements and credits. This is a significant difference from the stance of "giving help equality to anyone regardless of status". Quest Society prioritizes help to those who help others, and welcome anyone to join and become a helper so every call of help is answered.

              <b>Ivy:</b> Quest Society is designed to allow money systems to exist side by side independently with no intention to abolish or maintain monetary system. Quest Society takes the stance to let people voluntarily choose to participate. A helper may have a for-profit business, and get Quest Society credits when they give help without other incentives.

              <b>Ivy:</b> Since a helper's credit is pulic information and is used for prioritization, Quest Society does not using the term "Altruism" in describing helpers and does not claim to be promoting altruism. A helper may self-proclaim to be altruistic, but that term is officially and intentionally left undefined in Quest Society.

Sections of natural resource is designated for people to live independently as solo or tribal survivalists.

              <b>Black:</b> Quest society is like working on open source software. There is no "deadline". You contribute at your leisure. Since credits are automatically given, you don't have to rely on people who choose to donate after using your code. When they use it you get the credit already, and it is "free" to the user.

            <button class=""></div></button><hide>
              <b>Ledia:</b> Quest Society works by dividing traditional job role into smaller quests. That means efficiency can be maximized because a person can super specialize themself to just do one thing but do a lot of them. Of course this only lasts if the demand for the quest type is recurring.

            <b>Ivy:</b> The millionaire would get the credit. Unless the quest giver rejects help from them. The quest giver may appoint a helper out of favorism, then both the millionaire and the actual helper would get credit

          <button class=""></div></button>
          <hide>
            <b>Ivy:</b> I think if you do that, the Quest Society would become anti-automation. If a Quest can be routinely be completed more efficiently by automation, then the Quest Society needs to give automation inventors the credit volume to reward their effort of creating that automation. Please find other ways to get credits. If you need credits for something, hopefully your need will also be taken care of by something in an efficient manner.

          <hide>
            <b>Ivy:</b> There is a violation because you are discriminating against the helper. You may ask for a live demonstration of how someone like you (a human being) would bake a cake. But you cannot discriminate against a demonstrator who is actually a robot. So you could submit that as a quest, and you could intentionally interview and reject robot demonstrators, but those you reject would still get credit.

            <b>Ledia:</b> There is some detail that needs to be freshed out here. If I get 1000 helpers, I don't think all of them should get credits, otherwise they are getting credits by just signing up on a task that has low demand. 
          </hide>
          <button class=""></div></button>
          <hide>
            <b>Ivy:</b> The amount of credit a quest is worth, is based on supply and demand. So yes. You do get credits just for signup and offering help. But the credit is less that other quests with higher demand than supply. The system will also penalize those who don't actually show up to help when selected. A helper signs up for notification when a quest is posted. If they accept to do a quest, they should follow through if selected.

          <button class=""></div></button>
          <hide>
            <b>Ivy:</b> That kind of situation should be dealt as a reward. That means people go to your profile and request a reward. And if you want to function within Quest Society, then you create a reward object, which is "LRRH's cake". Then people bid with their credits. You get credit when you deliver the cake to the highest bidder.

          </hide>
          <button class=""></div></button>
          <hide>
            <b>Ivy:</b> First, if you post it at the rewards category, then helpers other than you won't need to consider and plan for the quest. This keeps the quest section focused on tasks where people just want to get done as efficiently as possible. Second, unlike quests, rewards have a COST. People are bidding for your cake in that section, your cake is not free. People who wants your cake but not other people's cake are spending credit for their specific and unyielding interest.

            <b>Ivy:</b> Most people encounter ‚Äúquests‚Äù only in role-playing games. The player character, typically an Adventurer, may do optional quests to earn in-game rewards, or just for the fun of questing.<br>
            While there are in-game quests that are ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù to complete before the player character may progress in the storyline or to advance to the next area, in terms of the overall experience, those quests are optional because by and large no one needs to play a computer game to survive; on the contrary, the player often pays for the game and buy in-game items and spend many hours playing it, sometimes with more passion and motivation to improve than doing their real job, even if the actions they do in the games are comparable to real life jobs:<br>
            ‚≠ê Helping people, running errands<br>
            ‚≠ê Investigating issues and solving problems<br>
            ‚≠ê Charting the unknown, sharing discoveries<br>
            <div></div>
            While some people do get paid to play games, the vast majority of the players do not. They play because it is fun. It is fun because they are optional: The player chooses to play when they want to.<br>
            A quest-based society redefines how a society functions by turning tasks that are good for society into voluntary quests.

  <msg spk="Ledia">That's actually quite compelling reasoning.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I see that the bias in you is strong. It is not quite compelling. It is totally compelling.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">But if people like you keep buying, they will keep making regardless whether there was a kickstart. They put a discount on the retail price, but they are still probably making a good profit.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">They are probably putting them on sale because they need inventory space for more consumer items.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Sasha's show of confidence is backfiring XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Okay, then tell me what I need to do to get that game.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I thought we are trying to convince you not to. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I am not promising anything, but could we sort or prioritize the board game inventory list?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Why do you need me to sort them? Couldn't you just sort them by genre?</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">I don't know what genre there are.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Do we really care about the genre? I think we should just sort them by whether we would enjoy playing it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I worry that if we don't list them by genre, we would forget whether we have the game. üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">How about each of you mark the game that you are most interested in?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">It's a trap. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think that is a fun exercise. üôÇ</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">At the same time I will group them by genre</msg>

  <div class=""><b>So</b> I've got an idea about Sasha's collection of board games. Why don't we set up a library of sort and let people borrow them?
  <msg spk="Casey">Since 99% of the time we are not playing with them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">And I already talked to Sasha this morning and she was okay with it. So this thread is not about whether we may, but what to do next.</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I'm somewhat surprised that Sasha would okay it.
  <msg spk="Casey">I'm not entirely surprised because if that results in some games outside the guild, that would make room for the guild. That means Sasha can get even more stuff.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">This is like the opposite of banking. You're giving away stuff so that you can get more.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I'm not giving them away. I'm just letting people borrow it. I'm not losing anything and I get more space and opportunity to get more. It is total Win-Win.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">That deserves a recognition. XD</msg>
  <mbrec>Sasha and Casey are recognized for Win-Win mindset.</mbrec>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think that is a good service. üòä</msg>

  <msg spk="Sasha">See? There is nothing wrong with me. It is a socially good skill. I'm looking for good deals for everyone.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">OMG that's a herald skill. XD</msg>
  <mbrec>Sasha is recognized as a deal finder.</mbrec>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Should we post the whole list?
  <msg spk="Black">There is no sign that there is a demand for borrowing board games. Maybe we should just post some up and see if there is a demand.</msg>

      <h4>Puzzle</h4>
      A woman lives on the 30th floor and hates taking the stairs. Every day she takes the elevator down to the lobby floor to go to work. When she comes home from work, she takes the elevator to the 20th floor and walks the rest of the way up, except on days when it rains. Those days she takes the elevator all the way home. Why does she walk the last ten flights of stairs if she hates it so much?

        The woman is too petite to reach the button for the 30th floor. She can only reach the 20th floor button. On days when it rains, she uses her umbrella to hit the button for the 30th floor.

      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        1Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritize tasks: Make a to-do list and prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency. Focus on completing the high-priority tasks first.<br>

        2Ô∏è‚É£ Break tasks into smaller chunks: Large tasks can be overwhelming, so break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This helps you stay motivated and makes it easier to track your progress.<br>

        3Ô∏è‚É£ Eliminate distractions: Identify and eliminate anything that distracts you from completing tasks. This might include turning off notifications on your phone or blocking certain websites during work time.<br>

        4Ô∏è‚É£ Schedule breaks: Take regular breaks to recharge and avoid burnout. This can help you stay focused and be more productive overall.<br>

        5Ô∏è‚É£ Learn to say no: It's important to learn to say no to non-essential tasks and requests that could take up valuable time. Prioritize your own tasks and don't be afraid to decline requests that don't align with your goals.

  <div class=""><b>We</b> finished reading Fate Core a few days ago. What should we read next?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> How about the Mice &amp; Mystics game manual? So that we could continue the game?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it is better if we read that with a computer so we can take notes without reading it twice.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Are you only considering PDFs that you can read on a phone? The guild bookcase still has many books unread.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Digital only. XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I think it isn't really a good idea to read/study at lunch. Even if you take notes at lunch, you are esentially taking notes twice when you type it up on a computer. It is not efficient.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Can't you just remember what you read and type it up later? XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">That would normally disrupt a person's focus for the rest of the day.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Maybe the lunch hour is more suited for tasks related to Cardinal Quest, such as planning what to do after lunch.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think normally we already know what we will do after lunch.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Lunch time is good for memorizing lyrics!
  <msg spk="Zoey">That only works because you aren't eating XD</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">You don't have to sing out loud ‚≠ê</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If we read, at least we have something to discuss. If we memorize lyrics, we would just be doing our own thing separately.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I see news as a good substitude because we don't normally need to take notes for news.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't want to read the news in detail. It is too boring XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> If there is no good idea, it might be best to just cut the lunch time shorter and continue.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then the lunch time study is dead. XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">You can still study, I am just saying doing so at lunch is not efficient.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> You could read Magic Bakery content and log bugs.
  <msg spk="Zoey">Lunch time proof-reading club. XD</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Maybe lunch time is good for short discussion. We could think of a topic and just discuss.
  <msg spk="Ivy">That's still inefficient without a computer, and it is inefficient to use a computer while eating.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I have a very crazy idea. What if we simply don't eat in the field? We eat before we go. If you are eating just once a day anyway then you can do it.
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think the meal will be too early. That would be a difference between just breakfast or just lunch.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I think the timing will be almost the same.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Are we talking about getting food at the field but eat it the next day? I know there is a refrigerator, but... üòÖ</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">And I like eating in the field. We get to see other people. üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Tanya's idea seems the best to me. @Arena is picking up some momentum. We need some good questions to highlight the differences among the philosophies. As we read the news, we can come up with the question we can use for Arena.
  <msg spk="Tanya">The most important thing is for us to confirm that our philosophies can be applied objectively in those situations. We should be able to reach a point where the news doesn't bring any new challenge to our philosophies, then we can work on the gamification aspect.</msg>

        <b>Freedom</b> is the range of access that a being may obtain without receiving retaliation. <br>
        <b>Liberty</b> is the range of freedom that a person or a group recognizes to not violate.<br>
        <b>Right</b> is the range of freedom that a person or group recognizes not only to not violate, but to provide.

      <hide><hr>
        <h4>Concepts</h4>
        ‚≠ê Freedom is not always "good" <msg spk="James">In this definition, freedom is an objectively measurable description of what a being can do without retaliation. An unopposed Tyrant enjoys a high degree of freedom. That does not imply that the Tyrant's actions are "good". Freedom by itself is a neutral term.</msg>
        <div></div>
        ‚≠ê Freedom is violated if access is restricted. <msg spk="James">A person who cannot fly is said to be free to fly to another place if transportation is provided to effect the result. An argument that "You don't have a means to escape, but since I am not stopping you from trying to find a means to escape (which does not exist for you), you are still free" is invalid.</msg>
        <div></div>
        ‚≠ê Simply letting others be may not be enough to grant them freedom <msg spk="James">If a community advertises "everyone is free to have one house", it implies that as long as a person wants a house, they would be given a house even when they contribute nothing in building it. If there are actually enough houses for everyone, but there is no retaliation for owning one house, the advertisement wording would be "everyone is free to compete for and own one house." </msg>
        <div></div>
        ‚≠ê Freedom may be violated for justice. <msg spk="James">Since freedom is a neutual term, the practice of "justice" routinely violates a being's freedom. A tyrant might say, "If you don't let me murder political dissenters, you are limiting my freedom." Whereas reciprocative justice would say, "Because you (the tyrant) is willing to murder political dissenters, othere are allowed to murder you as a political dissenter. When this situation arise, it means that there is no liberty to murder political dissenters.</msg>

      <hide><hr>
        <h4>Conceptual Self-test</h4>
        ‚≠ê Anna is brought to a room where the only doorway of escape is rigged with a contraption that would electrocute her if she tries to open it. Is Anna free to leave?
        <msg spk="James">No, because the contraption creates a retaliation force against her leaving. The existence retaliation force does not require intentionality. It doesn't take a villain for a person to have their freedom limited. Nature or the situation can do that already.</msg>
        <div></div>   
        ‚≠ê What is one thing that can be changed about the scenario above so that Anna is free to leave? <msg spk="James">If there is a button to disable the electricity and Anna is informed and understand that she can push it when she wants to leave.</msg>
        <msg spk="Ledia">If she is capable of leaving by breaking through the wall. This doesn't excuse the "villain" for bringing her to that place. The villain can be violating Anna's liberty to leave but fail in actually trapping her.</msg>
        <msg spk="James">Imposed costs violates freedom regardless whether the subject can afford to pay the cost. So if Anna was brought to the room against her will, the effort she exerts to overcome the situation make it not free, even if she is allowed or compensated thereafter.</msg>

  <msg spk="LRRH">If a philosophy does not have a way to deal with scarcity, then when that happens, the community is vulnerable to reverting to a method they knew, and that could overturn the philosophy.

    <div class=""><b>Suppose</b> there is work that people don't want to do. How does your philosophy get that work done?</div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Capitalism</h4>
      <div class=""></div> 
      You can pay more until someone is willing to do it. If no one else wants to do that and you need it done, do it yourself. You don't have a right to force others to do it for you.
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4><lnk>202208181056|Quest Society</lnk></h4>
      <div class=""></div> 
      People are normally allowed to barter, volunteer, or come to a mutual agreement (such as taking turns) on who shall do the work. For tasks that are social good, Quest Society offer an additional system where the doers may earn credits.
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Prosocialism</h4>
      <div class=""></div> 
      Prosocialism fosters joy in doing good so that there is no good deed that is unwanted. As long as a deed is good, a prosocialist would be glad to do it even when doing so would free up those who would be deemed responsible in traditional justice. 
    </div>
    <h4>Comparison: Does your philosophy give you a right to force innocent people to do unwanted work?</h4>
    <div class="">
      <h4>No</h4>
      <div class=""></div> Capitalism | 
      <div class=""></div> Honorism | 
      <div class=""></div> Prosocialism | 
      <div class=""></div> Quest Society | 
      <div class=""></div> Stewardism
    </div>
    <h4>Comparison: Does your philosophy have a mechanism that allows a person to systematically make others do unwanted work?</h4>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Yes</h4>
      <div class=""></div> 
      <b>Capitalism</b> allows a capital owner who has enough market or capital pressure on others to do unwanted work. But there is no simple path for that to actually happen. So in reality this is not something you need to worry about.
      <button class=""></div></button><hide>
        <b>Ivy:</b> Objection: Enclosure pressure is happening in reality. It doesn't take a single business controlling the market to create that pressure. Businesses can implicitly collude to create a joint pressure for cheap labor. This pressure exists in capitalistic society even when there is no tax and no welfare because The power to create that pressure comes from allowing extended ownership of land / resources.
      </hide>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>No</h4>
      <div class=""></div> 
      <b>Quest Society</b> maintains open access areas as a foundation of autonomy. There is no means for a person to exclude people from supplying themselves. Whereas a capitalist could own enough land, and give the tenants no choice but to provide not only for themselves but also for the landlord.
      <div></div>
      <div class=""></div> 
      <b>Stewardism</b> awards stewardship to people who make life affordable. If an unwanted work is tied to living affordability (such as cleaning the sewage of a city), the worker has priority to live in that city. It is illegal to hire a maintenance person to do maintenance work without also giving them the option to part of the community they maintain.
      <div></div>
      <div class=""></div> 
      <b>Honorism</b> awards honor to those who do good deeds, more so to do who voluntarily step up to do good deeds that people normally are unwilling to do. Honorism promotes this behavior by recognitions, although many honorable people do not expect or rely on such recognitions and would do good without any external acknowlegement.

  <msg spk="LRRH">

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> That thread has this scenario: An adult is trying to steal things from hosues, and is able to do at houses where the child would open the door by themselves.

  <msg spk="LRRH">Why do you think they pick that post as a target but not others? There must be a difference.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">The difference is just that "enable" implies volition to some people. But what I am saying is people who would latch onto you would not consider there are different dictionaries and neutral usages. You can't explain your way out.</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't know. Maybe you can't. XD Your focus on the victim was the issue. Say if the criminal only targets men but not women, you can't say "The crime happens in that alley because the victim happens to be a man.", and defintely not "The crime was enabled when the man entered the alley". XD You could only say "The criminal targets men."</msg>
  <div></div><div class="", you shall expect to be called victim-blaming. The point is the victim should be allowed to keep every habit they have and not be attacked. You may offer to patrol the street, but you can't tell anyone who is innocent to change any behavior as a counter measure. They are not responsible to make any adjustment to reduce a crime.
  <msg spk="LRRH">I don't have an agenda of reducing crime. I was just asking based on casuality and description.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> People make quick assumptions when you enter a thread. Outside the thread, unless you are a detective not knowing the fact that the Child opened the door, The difference is obvious and does not warrant repeated mention.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Why did you reply there to begin with?
  <msg spk="LRRH">Because to me the word enable is neutral. I don't think the tweeter deserve the accusations. I wanted the tweeter know that they aren't alone and I understand them and can believe that they are innocent.</msg>

  <msg spk="Evelyn">It is actually not much different from the newer statues, just... smaller?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">They should be about the same overall length. The container of the its crystal just didn't extend all the way.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see.</msg>

  <msg spk="Tanya">@StarTree, could you start a node for Dawn Island quest?</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">How would that be different from @Arena?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">That page would list Arcacian Principles and link to tweets aligned with that principle.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think that would be pretty difficult because people don't normally tell their principle when they post their opinion on something.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It is just a suggestion.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">üõéÔ∏è</div><b>Sasha:</b> I think we just need to post more Arcacia pictures because she is pretty.
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Could we stick to a bakery theme?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I didn't suggest otherwise.</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> By the way, on Twitter I came across a website  for people to post what they want or could offer for free.
  <msg spk="Evelyn">It seems fitting for the question. üòä</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> So far we have two ideas: Make a page connecting concepts from others; and Draw more Arcacia with Bakery theme.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> It is not an idea exactly an idea of promoting Arcacianism, but may be we can promote content of kindness and people helping each other?
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think the page I mentioned would do so.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I meant directly at Twitter, even if we don't mention Arcacianism. Such as retweeting content that is kind.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">That is Mankyoka. That is an Arcacia move. Retweeting things that are good.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">If you only retweet things you believe is good, wouldn't that give people less chance to see things they like but you reject?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I don't think Arcacia is about that kind of neutrality. Arcacia is known as a gatekeeper. She is a filter. As Dough Master she selects ingredients.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then what is Unconditional Love in Arcacianism?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think it is like Arcacia says sorry then turns a cookie back into a dough.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">So Arcacianism is not about unconditional love.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think Pacifism is more about unconditional love.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">But both Helen and Arcacia and happy and kind. They both don't get angry.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Does unconditional love just mean not getting angry. I think it means more.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">They are not angry not just because they are apathetic, but they see something good in others, like a better self that others are capable of becoming. (?)</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Then Arcacianism has a concept of unconditional love, of the better selves that lie within.</msg>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I want to volunteer for a "Let's make LRRH cuter" project.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> We can only run a test on a philosophy that has a definition.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Could you define the Mirror Test?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> The Mirror Test means creating a copy of a champion promoting the same philosophy and see what happens if the original champion would agree with what the other champion does. If the original champion can't tolerate what happens, then the philosophy fails the mirror test. Failing the mirror test means that the champion would not have liked the philosophy if someone else were to practice it against them.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Other than the Mirror Test, are there other coherence tests?</msg>
  <msg spk="Black">If a champion makes a claim, you could run that claim against their definition to check of contradictions. That is not a mirror test, but it is a coherence test.</msg>

        <b>Mirror Test</b> applies a set of proposed philosophy against the proposer from a different actor to check if the proposer would still agree with the proposal if they are on the receiving end. The philosophy fails the Mirror Test if the proposer would reject the philosophy when it is reciprocated.

  <div class=""><b>For</b> Philosophical Arena, we need a definition on what Neutral means.
  <msg spk="Tanya">There are different kinds of anti, pro, and neutral. And a philosophy can have different treatment toward self and others.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Can we find unambiguous terms for each situation?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> For the context of the discussion, let's use assault, which is unprovoked initation of physical violence.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> A pacifist pledges not to initiate assault. They refrain from assaulting. A pacifist who chooses to assault is not a pacifist. Refraining is part of the identity of a pacifist.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> As opposed to identity, a diplomatic stance describes what a pacifist would do when someone is assaulting them, or assaulting a third party.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> When a pacifist is the target of assault, a pacifist could absorb or avoid the attack, they could sanction, but not counter-attack.
  <msg spk="Tanya">So a pacifist is anti-counter attack when they are the target.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Now, if Ann is the target of assult, does a pacifist forbid Ann from counter attack?
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think Pacifism is similiar to compassionism. They are neutral to helping or forbid Ann from counter attack. Within pacifism there are different sub groups.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In that case, rather than saying Pacifism has a neutral stance toward Ann's counter attack. I propose that we should say Pacifism is Ambivalent.
  <msg spk="Tanya">If it does not have a set stance, then it has an Ambivalent stance.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Then Neutral would specifically mean that as long as you are a Pacifist, you would let Ann decide whether to counter attack, without specifically funding or sanctioning of them if they choose to.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I agree.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Shouldn't a philosophy's stance toward a member or others all part of a philsophy's identity? Say if a Pacifist is supposed to be neutral toward Ann's counterattack, then if someone supports Ann's counterattack they would lose the quality to be identified as a Pacifist.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Could you propose a word for it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Maybe you don't need a word for it? You could say Pacifists are Anti assault. They don't initiate themselves, and they condemn others who do. In all cases they are anti.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">But there are situations where a philosophy is anti something toward its followers, but not when others are doing it.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">For example, compassionism pledges not to be cruel, but does not necessarily try to stop others to be cruel. You could say they are pro-rescuring and helping victims, but there are not necessarily anti abusing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I kind of see what you mean.</msg>

        <hide> 
          <b>Natalie:</b> Although many paladins do have cleric skills in pacifying heated discussions, the paladin skills in that context focus on assessing the physical threat on scene and removing factors that enable violence if the situation escalates.<br><br>
          To decide whether to intervene, a paladin considers the weapons on scene, the distance between the participants and how early they need to act for their skills to be effective. In general, two people arguing without arms reach is too close if one were to strike another.<br><br>
          A palain may start acting by doing the following while the conflict is only verbal.<br><br>
          1) Confirm whether both parties intend to fight. (Paladins don't need to stop consensual fights.)<br>
          2) Keep a path clear for the willing party to escape<br>
          3) Remove objects that can be used as weapons<br>
          4) Call for backup<br><br>
          If a party starts attacking, a paladin may intercept the attack. A paladin should follow this priority depending on their skills and the harm if the attacker is not stopped.<br><br>
          1) Neutralize an attack so that no one is hurt.<br>
          2) Extract the victim from harm.<br>
          3) Deflect or absorb an attack to minimize damage.<br>
          4) Reflect an attack back to the attacker.<br>
          5) Immobilizing the attacker.<br>
          6) Counter attack the attacker.<br>

        ‚≠ê Protest
        <msg spk="Sasha">What is the role of paladins during a protest?</msg>
        <msg spk="Natalie">Protesters have a right to reciprocate against the offender, but not to bystanders. The role of paladins remains to protect innocent people from physical harm.</msg>
        <msg spk="Natalie">Siding with indepedence: When the reason for a protest is against oppression by a government (e.g. The people do not want to be governed by the reigning regime), paladins side with those seeking independence, protecting them in discussing how to break free from the regime and agains retaliations by the regime. Paladins are allows to free political prisoners, protect governments seeking independence, and topple government seeking to destroy those seeking independence. Since Paladin skills are physical skills, their involvement in those situation should be a last resort.</msg>
        <msg spk="Natalie">De-escalation within progress: To keep physical confrontation as a last resort, paladins adopts the concept of de-escalation while meaningful progress is made. De-escalation here means that while the victim of oppression is qualified to reciprocate with more force, paladins encourage the situation be resolved with less force as long as the offender is keeping its promises to make changes and make amends. However, paladins would not stop a victim if they choose to reciprocate in full force.</msg>

A general philosophy of paladins is to build a reputation of overwhelming response so that a potential attacker would give up their attempt.</msg><br>
        üè∞ <b>As a last resort</b>
        <msg spk="Natalie">Intercepting an attack does not imply harming the attacker. However, if the defending paladins have no other means to protect the innocent from imminent harm, it is within Paladin Moral code to counter attack, including harming the attacker in order to stop them.</msg><br>

      <hide class="">
        <div class=""></div>
        While the role of the Police varies in different places, here are what makes Paladins different from the typical role of the Police.<br>
        ü•• <b>Not Law Enforcers</b> 
        <msg spk="Natalie">Paladins use their physical protection and combat skills to stop fights. Paladin code of conduct differentiates between using force to deter physical attacks, and using force to enforce compliance. A Paladin would lose honor if they use their force for the later.</msg><br>
        üß• <b>No Extra Authorities</b>
        <msg spk="Natalie">Paladins have the same authority as any normal citizen. Paladin code assert that everyone has a right defend themselves. A Paladin is just a normal citizen with training and focus on using such skills to protect others.</msg><br>
        ‚öñÔ∏è <b>Independent Operators</b>
        <msg spk="Natalie">While they typically train with and work with those in their preferred guilds, Paladins are consider independent operators. A person can be a paladin without joining any guild and may protect people anywhere unopposed by other paladins if their same rules of engagement. No one needs a license to do what a paladin does. The skill set, the ethic code and the credits are available to everyone.</msg><br>

        [3] <div class=""></div> What is the difference between Paladins and Vigilantes?</div>
      <hide class="">
        <div class=""></div>
        While there are many different kinds of vigilantes, paladins are considered different from vigilantes in the following ways.<br>
        ‚öîÔ∏è <b>Protection, not revenge</b> 
        <msg spk="Ledia">Paladins are about protecting people against physical threats, not exacting revenge. As long as the threat exists, a paladin may act within reason regardless whether the source of the threat had wronged anyone, or whether it acted with malice.</msg><br>
        üèõÔ∏è <b>Paladins are often part of the law</b>
        <msg spk="Ledia">The term 'vigilante' often denote people who act without legal authorization. While paladins may act without authorization, paladins are often recognized by the law and has accepted public dispatch system for a community to call for paladin assistance.</msg><br>
        üß≥ <b>Paladins Travel</b>
        <msg spk="Ledia">While vigilantes are often intertwined with local clans and politics, paladin helping a location are often independent with no-ties to the locals. Paladins are not paid by the people seeking help, they travel to areas of distress away from their training grounds to earn honor directly from their headquarters.</msg><br>

        [4] <div class=""></div> What is the difference between Paladins and the Military?</div>
      <hide class="">
        <div class=""></div>
        Although Paladins and a Military both use forces and are at first glance ‚Äúmilitarized‚Äù, here are some fundamental differences:<br>
        üåê <b>Purpose</b> 
        <msg spk="Natalie">Paladins exist to protect human rights against physical threats. This protection is borderless. This is different from a military that serves only the interest of a country or a leader.</msg><br>
        üìØ <b>Command Structure</b> 
        <msg spk="Natalie">Paladins can operate as independent individuals. One could visualize them as armed good samaritans, following and protected by good samaritan laws as applied to medical assistance. They can operate without following any order. They are also responsible for their actions and judgment of quests.</msg><br>
        ‚úã <b>Voluntary Participation</b> 
        <msg spk="Natalie">Paladins are never drafted into action. There is no law against ‚Äúdesertion‚Äù since each paladin is free to leave a group that they joined. There are many paladins who simply operate independently by themselves without joining any group. </msg><br>

    </div><!--[4] Isn't it Boring? -->
    <div class="">
      <div class="">
        [5] <div class=""></div> Our world is mostly peaceful, isn't it boring to be a paladin?</div>
      <hide class="">
        <div class=""></div>
        Paladins get credits in two main ways: Training and Incident.<br>
        ‚≠ê <b>Training Credits</b> 
        <msg spk="Natalie">A paladin gets credit for keeping their body in good physical shape and for maintaining their equipment, skill, and teamwork in combat simulations and wargames. There are many tournaments and competitions that would award paladin training credits.</msg><br>
        ‚≠ê <b>Incident Credits</b>
        <msg spk="Natalie">When an incident happens and paladin skills are needed, paladins flock to seize those opportunities to get the higher honor incident credits. The more rare the incidents, the more overwhelming the response would be.</msg><br>
        ‚òéÔ∏è <b>On-call</b>
        <msg spk="Natalie">Other than training and deploying to an actual incident, paladins can also get credits for being on-call and for patrolling areas that need routine protection. But unlike a job role society, paladins are not required to fill those roles. They choose to do so and are compensated based on supply and demand at those locations and time slots. Many paladin who do sign up for those roles are locals and they feel strong commitment and belonging to the towns they love and protect. Since on-call compensation is set automatically based on supply and demand, the paladins self-balance to fill the vacancies.</msg><br>
        üèÖ <b>As a sub class</b>
        <msg spk="Natalie">Beyond paladin quests, paladins can also learn skill in other disciplines and do other quests. We encourage people from any discipline to get some paladin skills so that they are empowered to protect their own cities.</msg><br>

      üìí Into The Open Economy | 
      
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Highlights</h4>
      <h4>The Limitations of Governance</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 13: A government exists mainly to protect trade. 
      <msg spk="LRRH">What about protection, mediation of conflicts, and custody of public properties?</msg><div></div>

      ‚≠ê Page 13: Printing money doesn't solve anything. <msg spk="LRRH">Printing money to spend on a specific issues directs people's effort on those issues.</msg><div></div>
      
      ‚≠ê Page 13: When the economy is good, the government spends, when the economy is bad, the government cuts back. <msg spk="LRRH">Government spending is not home economics. A government spends when there is a need.</msg><div></div>

      ‚≠ê Page 14: Conception of nations <msg spk="LRRH">You would need something like nations if you let people have different laws.</msg><div></div>

      ‚≠ê Page 15: Laws are blunt instruments <msg spk="LRRH">Laws are part of the education on what is acceptable and what is not. May be Colin meant he is okay with principles but not "Laws".</msg><div></div>
      <h4>The Limitations of Trade</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 16: Free market leads to concentration of power <msg spk="LRRH">This is generally true. The problem is not trade exists, but there is no limit of what can be traded.</msg><div></div>

      ‚≠ê Page 18: Money is created from nothing and we are in debt <msg spk="LRRH">For commerce, as more people produce more things, there is supposed to be more money created based on the amount of value in the market. What people call a debt is not an actual debt to anyone that needs to be repaid in a correct money system.</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Disconnection</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 20: Trading helps get people disconnected to each other <msg spk="LRRH">Shouldn't it be the opposite? If you love something made in another country, then you would care about the well-being of that country. üê£</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Solution One</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 23: A reset only restart the problem because the system did not change. <msg spk="LRRH">Agreed</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Solution Two</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 24: An Open Economy without trade or governance. <msg spk="LRRH">Need more details to understand what this means.</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>What is an Open Economy?</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 28: An Open Economy is... <msg spk="LRRH">Colin's definition is a redefinition disaster. According to the message, what he calls an open economy is a decentralized totalitarian economy based on every actor agreeing with each other what to do.</msg><div></div> 

      ‚≠ê Page 30: We would over fish if we don't have a common interest to keep the fish from going extinct <msg spk="LRRH">This message seems really old and governments are already doing this. This can happen while trade and governace are happening. This is not something that only an Open Economy could do.</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Our Priorities</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 31: Set our priorities closer to Self, Community, World, then everything else <msg spk="LRRH">This concept is similar or the same as Stewardism.</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Shifting our Priorities</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 34: Use media and make it fashionable <msg spk="LRRH">Agreed.</msg><div></div> 
      ‚≠ê Page 35: Make sharing the norm <msg spk="LRRH">I have reservation. Sharing is not always good. It depends on what is being shared and who the object is shared to. Typically when things are freely shared, the receiver perceives it to have less value than it actually has. That can lead to waste.</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Removing our Artificial Limits</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 36: Borders create animosity <msg spk="LRRH">This is somewhat an overgeneralization. There are borders created for good reasons, and borders created for bad reasons.</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Living in an Open Economy</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 38: Abundance make money obsolete <msg spk="LRRH">This only happens if there is zero variance in life and opportunity can repeat.</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Social Gravity</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 39: We are a social species <msg spk="LRRH">This presentation is ignoring social conflicts.</msg><div></div> 
      <h4>Self-Determination</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 41: Most of anarchists are peaceful <msg spk="LRRH">Possibly, if they exist in nature where they are not overcrowded.</msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Page 42: Self-determining societies don't need laws <msg spk="LRRH">Disagree. This is assuming no variance in communities. A community needs to state its laws so people know what they are joining.</msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Page 43: Abundance to survival needs would bring peace <msg spk="LRRH">Disagree. People would who are fed can still dislike each other. </msg><div></div>
      <h4>Natural Boundaries</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 44: You can still own a home in Open Economy <msg spk="LRRH">This is one of those issues where laws would help define how much natural boundary a person may have. </msg><div></div>
      <h4>Open Education</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 45: The best way to approach education: Self, Community, World.Three levels of insight: Awareness, Respect, Understanding. <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society uses quests as part of the education system to teach how the world works and what the world needs. It is an open education system because a person chooses what they want to learn for their amusement or to empower them to do quests. </msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Page 46: Periodical aptitude tests <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society does not have periodical aptitude test. A person may take aptitude tests to explore their strength, but it not required. A person does not need to do quests they are best at.</msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Page 46: The primary purpose of learning should be to create adults who can reach the summit of their unique potential <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society does not have such goal. It is up to the individual why they want to learn.</msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Page 47: The relevant, practical lessons on life, respect and social skills must take precedence in order to create better, happier people. <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society does not have such agenda. Training is free and self-paced. Guidance is free but optional.</msg><div></div>
      <h4>Community Service</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 49: Every member of the community would be asked to contribute a reasonable minimum number of hours per month to dedicate to their community and the greater good.
      <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society intentionally does not have such duty. But Guilds and other free associations may have that as membership requirement.</msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Page 50: Tasks could be turned into sports events.
      <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society is based on this, and gets rid of the month requirement to make it entirely optional.</msg><div></div>
      <h4>Resource Allocation</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 51: Maintaining inventories and tend to requests based on urgency and benefit to community. 
      <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society organizes this using quests. The focus is on whether helper of that quest shall be awarded credits.</msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Page 52: Skill Roster for someone in need to contact someone with the skill. 
      <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society would maintain a skill roster for a different purpose: to encourage learning of a skill when the community has a shortage of people with such skills.</msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Page 52: Community Store
      <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society gives credits to the providers. The credits give them priority to take. "Open Economy" is missing the mechanism to deal with people who just take and waste resources without contributing.</msg><div></div>
      <h4>Organic Leadership</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 53: Some kind of leadership structure is an efficient way of accomplishing complext tasks.
      <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society uses choice democracy and break down "complex tasks" into quests and subquests so teams with leaders of their choice can cooperate without "electing" an overall leader.</msg><div></div>
      <h4>Project Pledge Scheme</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 54: For large projects, willing workers publicly pledge to see the project through until completion.
      <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society breaks down large projects into sub quests and award credits. Quest Society intentionally does not require pledges to uphold autonomy. A quest doer may quit any time they want. They simply do not get credits for what they did not complete. </msg><div></div>
      <h4>A Community Awards System</h4>
      ‚≠ê Page 56: A Community Awards System would be a symbolic payment method
      <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society credits is not only symbolic. It is the mechanism to resolve scarcity in a way that that does not allow populism to overshadow actual contributors.</msg><div></div>
      <h4>An Open Proposal Platform</h4>

    <div class=""><b>Identifying</b> and solving the right problem saves wasted investment on an ineffective solution. What is the desired result? What caused the problem? What form should the solution take? Here are some considerations:</div>
    <div class="">
      <div class=""><b>Solving ignorance with guides</b> üìù</div>
      <hide>
        If the problem is a lack of information, the solution form might be a report with facts (a fact sheet), a procedural guide, a look-up table, or other forms of convenient information that helps a person know more without forcing them to memorize what they need to know. The guides could be visual or audio as long as it is effective. A picture is worth a thousand words. An effective diagram could help people understand and internalize knowledge even when memorization is not the aim.

      <div class=""><b>Accounting for details with checklists</b> ‚úÖ</div>
      <hide>
        Checklists are a way to make sure that every small details and requirements are accounted for without relying on people memorizing the details. For disambiguation, a checklist is not a todo list. A todo list shows tasks to be completed, while a checklist show the conditions that should be met for a task to be considered completed. By explicitly listing the requirements, the person doing the task can confirm the relevance of their efforts. If a checklist cannot be created because the requirements are unclear, then it is probably a good idea to confirm the requirements first to avoid wasted efforts. Therefore, creating a checklist is a good practice to ensure requirements are clear.<br>

        Validation is a step to confirm that the requirements listed on a checklist are correct. This step is especially important when the person doing the task is not the same person who will face the result.

      <div class=""><b>Guiding creative improvements with rubrics</b> üèÜ</div>
      <hide>
        Sometimes a problem calls for an innovative solution, so overly restrictive requirements or checklists would prevent creativity. In those cases, a rubrics can guide improvement by ranking better solution types even if they seem unattainable at the moment. By listing them early, the problem solvers can keep an eye for opportunity to do what was considered unattainment. It is not luck. It is preparation.

        <div class="">Constructive Mindset üß±</div>
        <hide>
          A constructive mindset seeks to pave a path toward the solution instead of trying to convince one's self or others that a problem cannot be solved. When there is no progress toward a solution, a constructive mindset asks "Why is this problem difficult? Why knowledge or tool am I missing to solve it? Where can I get help to solve it?" By asking and overcoming these difficulties, the problem solver lays the next tile toward the solution. To a constructive mindset, every brick wall is not an impasse but building materials for new paths.

        <div class="">Factual and not overly optimistic üìä</div>
        <hide>
          Being factual means trying to dispel uncertainties by experimenting, verifying, and acting earlier, instead of being unrealistically optimistic that every pieces of the puzzle will fall in place.  When there is a gap between the theoretical and actual results, an overly optimistic person would assert that the better result will prevail, while a factual problem solver would be careful and question why there is a gap. Was there an error in the prediction? Was the data gathered in the correct condition?

        <div class="">Welcoming new ideas and criticisms üöÄ</div>
        <hide>
          A problem solver is limited by their knowledge and available tools. Therefore, while a problem solver may feel proud of having found a solution, they shall not convince themselves that that is the best solution. By having an attitude to seek a better solution, a problem solver becomes more open to criticism, while they expand their knowledge and upgrade their tools. The best solution should be one where the problem cannot occur. That could be the result of a change in process or technology. A proactive problem solver should aim to be part of that change, not the resistance, even if the change would make their expertise in solving the old problem obsolete.

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> I think the conflict about women suffrage was about the order of event. It appears that the law can change <i>Faster</i> than people can migrate, therefore, if libertarians want to revert women suffrage at the state of federal level, they would first need a way for people to choose by migration.
  <msg spk="Tanya">That option is normally impractical because even if people are willing, they are still being coerced to move. So the most non-aggressive order of event is to incorporate new cities that are free from the federal government.</msg>

Then if you go to sitemap and list all nodes (1710), the memory usage jumps to about 330 MB. And on Chrome, you can inspect the source of the page and see all the images that it loaded into memory (e.g. LEGO story images <lnk>202203191203|üìú</lnk>, and Nextdoor Slides <lnk>202307231022|üìú</lnk>).

  <msg spk="3B">Is having just a static picture good enough?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">You could always make more and better ones. The purpose of the video is to draw people's attention to the Arcacianism node.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Then should we have an account in everything and post it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Yes, but we also don't want to have too little content at the node.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>LRRH:</b> How about we create an Arcacian Quest node? It is the quest of looking at situations and identify what is Arcacian and what is not.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think that is a good direction.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Arcacian Quest now has a node!</msg>
  <lnk>202209111200|Is this Arcacian?</lnk>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> How do we select or group topics related to Arcacian Quest?
  <msg spk="Ledia">I read an ad yesterday about a proposition to tax sport gambling to fund affordable housing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Should that be its own node?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think if someone is specifically asking about that proposition, then it would help for it to be its own node.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We can also have a node for each general topic: Gambling, Taxation, and Providing Housing. Each would be an Arena comparison topic.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Is anyone discussing this proposition?</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">Not that I know of. It is just an advertisement.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think we should start with issues that people do discuss. Preferrably from Twitter.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I can find it on Twitter. It is just not a popular topic.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think between gambling, taxation, and housing, housing is the most relevant. We could start with how Arcacianism provides housing.
  <msg spk="Ivy">Arcacianism would reward the helpers that provides housing to people who need but don't have housing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What if someone bets and loses their house? Do they get another one?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">In Stewardism that wouldn't matter. People with no house can still take from those with the most excess.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">What about crimes caused by gambling addiction, who is responsible? The gambling house or the gambler?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">In Hospitalianism, a zone can define itself to be gambling-free. The zone that shelters a gambler who becomes an intruder to another zone is responsible. That zone can decide how they deal with that intruder.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think in general people would not like that idea because it implies people are constantly moving whenever the law changes.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">If someone gambles but does not rob other people, why should he be responsible for the crime by someone irresponsible?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It is up to the gambling zone to define who exactly is responsible.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">In Hospitalianism, there is a free zone where a person might not belong to any government. What happens if they commit a crime?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">The hospitalian zone would have a right to claim resource from the free zone. The free zone would shrink.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Are you talking about the criminal is caught and is in a prison in a hospitalian zone?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I am talking about if the criminal is dead.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">For what crime?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Invasion. When the criminal is caught, the criminal could plead for alternative resolution, such as agreeing to live in an anti-addiction hospitalian zone. But the bottom lineis that a zone does not need to assume a person will change. They are at the mercy of someone who would bail them.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">But in either case, the Hospitalian zone would get the resource. then why won't they always try to execute the criminal?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Because if the criminal pleads to do good, the hospitalian zone would get their good deeds, and the resource if they end up living there until they die.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think we should start with housing. I was discussing how housing works in Stewardism, and I need visual aid.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Housing node created!</msg>
  <lnk>202209111548|Housing</lnk>
  <msg spk="LRRH">I think I need something more visual.</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">What kind of visual?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Maybe a map of how a city look presented by the champion?</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">Which one should I draw first?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">The maps of cities under different philosophies should not look too different, because a city is still organized by convenience and function. The difference in ownership, which is not normally visible from a map unless you mark it.</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">Then am I drawing one city map and color them differently based on who owns what?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I don't think you can tell the difference without drawing different cities. Although different philosophies can work on the same city, a city would be built differently depending on the philosophy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">We should be careful not being unfair if different philosophies could result in the same map.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> Then I'll draw a typical small town and have each champion color them differently?
  <msg spk="Sasha">That doesn't sound very exciting though. I think each champion should present the town they are proud of.</msg>
  <msg spk="Arcacia">How about a cook off? We would each make our model town.</msg>

<div id="P202209122227" class="">

    <div class=""><b>Open Access</b> is a concept of maintaining autonomy by letting people get what they need with their effort without forcing people to cooperate or take care of each other.</div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
      ‚≠ê Entitle to produce, not to others' products
      <msg spk="Casey">In an open access forest where people are allowed to enter and forage, a person who does not forage is not entitled to what the others gather. Similarly, in an open access farm, a person gets a share of the land to plant, but they are not entitled to the fruits that someone else plants.</msg><div></div>

      ‚≠ê Needs over wants
      <msg spk="Casey">For example, if you need a house (because you have none), you may get land and material to build it. But if you already have a house you may not take land to build your second house when someone needs that to build their first. </msg><div></div>

      ‚≠ê Neutrality to helping others
      <msg spk="Casey">Open Access as a concept does not encourage or discourage people to help each other. Helping each other is not required but allowed.</msg><div></div>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <div class="">
        ‚≠ê What about people who can't take care of themselves?
      </div>
      <hide>
        <div class=""></div>
        Open Access is not a complete societal philosophy. A philosophy that uses open access would add additional mechanism to address people who can't use such access to take care of themselves.<br>
        <hr>
        <b>Quest Society</b> maintains a roster of people who need to be taken care as a quest for voluntary caretakers to earn credits. <msg spk="Ivy">Example: Ann is old cannot get her own food. Bob signs up to help Ann get food. Bob then goes to the resource area with Ann's permission, so that he may take two shares of resources. Bob gives Ann her share, and Bob gets Quest credits for helping Ann. </msg><div></div>
      </hide>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <div class="">
        ‚≠ê Economy of Scale
      </div>
      <hide>
        
        Open Access uses endorsement to support economy of scale without sacrificing autonomy. 
        <msg spk="Ivy">Example: Amy has an idea to automate farming, but she needs at least 100 shares of resource for the system to be more efficient than 100 people farming separately.</msg> 
        <msg spk="Ivy">In a Quest Society, if she could gather 100 endorsements, then she is allowed to conduct that operation on those 100 shares, even if 200 other people are opposed to it. On top of being allowed to conduct his operation, Amy will also get Quest Credit for helping each endorsor. The result is the endorsors get food without farming, and Amy gets experience on creating the automation and credits for farming for others.</msg> 
      </hide>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <div class="">
        ‚≠ê You may get free stuff without working
      </div>
      <hide>
        Open Access creates some situations where people might get free stuff without working. <msg spk="LRRH">For example, when you are trying to bake a cake at an open access kitchen, if the cake doesn't turn out as perfect as you like, you could trade it for allowance to bake another. Then, the person who traded with you spends their allowance (which they would also spend if they were to bake a cake themself), but got a cake without baking it. </msg> 
      </hide>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Effects</h4>
      ‚≠ê Anti Enclosure 
      <msg spk="Ivy">Enclosure refers to closing access to resources and sites of production so that an owner may charge higher rent through artificial scarcity. Open Access does the opposite by letting people take care of themselves directly.</msg><div></div>
      ‚≠ê Anti Majority Rule 
      <msg spk="Ivy">Open Access is for individual autonomy. A group of 99 cannot veto the right of one to choose differently for herself. </msg><div></div>

    <div class="" to facilitate discussion. In the following definition, the <i>amount</i> is not necessarily limited to money.</div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>ü•® MAGIC BAKERY DEFINITIONS</h4>
      <b>Price</b> is an agreed amount for an exchange of ownership. 
      <msg spk="LRRH">Example: The price of an apple is $1. You pay $1 and the apple become yours. </msg><div></div>

      <b>Fee</b> is an agreed amount for a service or access.
      <msg spk="James">Example: A toll booth charges a fee to cross the bridge. You pay the fee to be allowed to cross the bridge. You don't get anything tangible in return.</msg><div></div>

      <b>Tax</b> is an imposed amount to fund an operation.
      <msg spk="James">Example: A city wants to fund social services, and requires everyone to chip in.</msg><div></div>

      <b>Fine</b> is an imposed amount against undesirable behavior.
      <msg spk="James">Example: A city sees littering as a crime and imposes a fine on littering.  If you are caught littering, you pay a fine.</msg>
      <msg spk="LRRH">This means people are allowed to violate rights as long as they can pay for it.</msg>
      <msg spk="Ledia">A fine is normally create to discourage a behavior or to set a level of privilege. It exists in addition to (or sometimes, in the absence of) paying for damages.</msg><div></div>

      <b>Restitution</b> is the amount one pays to a victim to break even. <msg spk="Ledia">Example: John stole $100 from Mary. To break even, John needs to pay Mary $100 back.</msg><div></div>

      <b>Compensation</b> is the amount one pays to a victim beyond breaking even. <msg spk="Ledia">Example: John stole $100 from Mary. To break even, John needs to pay Mary $100 back as restitution because that is the amount he stole. As compensation John could be ordered to pay an additional $100 because that was the amount he thought he could steal from others. The victim gets the benefit that the offended intended for themself.</msg><div></div>

      <b>Reimbursement</b> is the amount one is paid to cover their cost of an action. <msg spk="Ledia">Example: As a good samaritan you used your first aid supplies to help someone. The city replenishes your first aid kit as reimbursement so you may help someone again.</msg><div></div>

      <b>Reward</b> is the amount one is paid for choosing to do a good deed. <msg spk="Ledia">Example: As a good samaritan you used your first aid supplies to help someone. On top of being reimbursed of the first aid supplies, you get a reward for choosing to help.</msg><div></div>

  <msg spk="LRRH">Welcome to Arcacian Quest, where we explore the meaning and effects of the Arcacian Principle: "Let people help each other and reward those who do."</msg>
  <lnk>202208201022|Arcacianism</lnk>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class="" to the Magic Bakery definition?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Yes, and it is "Tax is an imposed amount to fund an operation."
  <lnk>202209130935|Taxation</lnk>
  <div></div><div class="">üõéÔ∏è</div><b>Sasha:</b> Tax violates the principle because it is not simply letting people help, but FORCING people to help.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Does it mean that a carbon tax would violate Arcacian Principle?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think in Arcacianism, instead of a carbon tax, there would be a reward to those who help clean up the environment.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Do I lose credits if I pollute?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> In Stewardism, if you pollute you will lose the liberty to do whatever you do causing the pollution.
  <div></div><b>Casey:</b> Is that Arcacian? Stopping a polluter from polluting.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think Arcacianism would need to consider whether your polluting is helping. If it is, whether there is a better alternative that is less polluting.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I think it is implied that everyone is a victim of pollution. A person stopping the pollution is helping everyone. So Arcacian Principle lets that person help the rest by stopping the polluter.
  <msg spk="Casey">I thought the definition of help implies all parties are agreeing. If I am polluting, I am not agreeing to be stopped. The person trying to stop me is not helping me.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ivy">But you are polluting against other people's will. By reciprocation, since you allow yourself to impose damage to others, others may impose damage to you. Their reaction to you becomes a neutral action to you. You are correct that their stopping you is not "helping" you, but their stopping you would be default action that they can do, just like if they were walking around in circles.</msg>
  <msg spk="Casey">...so...?</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think that means reciprocation does not violate Arcacianism. It is allowed, but it does not qualify as helping. Therefore Arcacianism would be neutral toward rewarding reciprocation.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Say an arsonist is trying to set a forest on fire. Paladins are dispatched to stop the arsonist. Do we get Paladin credits for doing so? Yes we do. I don't think that result is neutral. I think it is Arcacian.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> The way I would explain it is that you would get credits because you are helping the Arsonist reconnect with their BETTER SELF who would not have done. Arcacia is an angel, she sees pass the superficial self.
  <mbaa>Sasha receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><div class="" That is all-you-can-use gaslighting.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> The Paladin code allows a person to act and judge whether the others involved would *eventually* agree that they were helping. So, at the heat of the moment, say someone wants to kill themself, a paladin is allowed to bet on the eventual outcome and save the distressed first. They are allowed to act using a consent in the future.
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I just want to say that I like this conversation because Arcacia is here. üòä
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> So. In summary, to apply the Arcacian Principle, the situation needs to be judged considering better selves and eventual consents. Is that practical?
  <msg spk="Ledia">I think that is how it has been working.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">You have statistics on what deeds people would eventually be thankful for. It is not unreasonable.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it is okay if you approach it with humbleness and love. You allow the possibility that you were wrong and did something they would not thank you.</msg>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Sasha:</b> So you are saying that to use Arcacian Principle, you need to act with love and be humble, see people's better self, judge based on whether they would eventually thank you for what you do.
  <msg spk="LRRH">We went way further than I was expecting. üç∞</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">If we use that to judge taxation, it boils down to people do not eventually like to be taxed. It is just imposed from start to end.</msg>
  <msg spk="Ledia">I agree.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think we should pin Sasha's summary to the Arcacianism node. @StarTree.</msg>

      ‚≠ê <code>mbpuzzle</code> is a flat frame with no border and no shadow. Its lighter color comes from an alpha value. Nesting them would make it even lighter. This frame was originally used by Mikela for displaying puzzles, but it turned out to be very convenient so it is used everywhere!

        <div class="">üç™ Cookie Jar Example</div>
        <hide>
        Imagine cookies are offered at a dining hall for sale with a glass jar to collect money for fund raising. There is no reasonable ambiguity that the cookies are for sale per cookie. They are not free, but there is no supervision. It is up to the honesty of the taker to put money in the jar. Depending on the character of the diners, we would expect the following interactions:
        <hr>
        üòá Proactively helpful <msg spk="Natalie">You read the fund raising information, if it is for a good cause and there is contact info, you contact them to offer direct help.</msg><div></div>
        üôÇ Honest and obedient <msg spk="Evelyn">You believe what the note says without second guessing whether it is a scam. If you take a cookie, you leave money in the jar.</msg><div></div>
        üç™ Try before you buy <msg spk="Fina">You try the cookie first. If it is good then you pay. If not you don't. </msg><div></div>
        üç™ Just eat <msg spk="Casey">You take the cookie and don't pay. If you are caught doing it, you pretend that you didn't see the sign or that you forgot to pay.</msg><div></div>
        üí∞ Take the money <msg spk="Sasha">If there is money in the jar, you take it. If they really want to collect money they need to be smarter. They may blame themselves for being naive.</msg><div></div>
        <hr>
        Depending on the composition of the dining hall visitors, both the cookie jar and the money jar might be empty by the end of the day. To measure robustness, we look at how little a population need to cheat for the system to fail. In this case, it only takes one person with "Take the money" mentality to empty the money jar. Next, imagine that instead of being completely unsupervised, the dining hall has a camera looking at the jars. Then one would expect the "Take the money" group will split into subgroups:<br>
        üí∞ Steal the money <msg spk="Sasha">Pretend to put money into the jar but in fact take money out. But now I can't take ALL the money because it would be too obvious...</msg><div></div>
        üé≠ Disguise and take <msg spk="Sylvia">Wear a mask, put on a different hoodie, then take the money.</msg><div></div>
        ‚öîÔ∏è Destroy the camera <msg spk="V">Destroy the camera then take the money.</msg><div></div>
        <hr>
        The subgroups come from "Take the money". With this split, less money is stolen from the jar because it requires someone willing to and able to deal with the camera to steal all the money. Comparing the two, having a camera is said to be more robust.
  
        <msg spk="Evelyn">What about the argument that security measures make a person believe that other people are worse than they are?</msg>
        <msg spk="Ivy">Robustness is not theoretically dervived, it is an empirical measurement. In the above example, I was really talking about trying different setups and measure what is left in the jars. But it is not easy to set up an experiment with control group containing people with genuine criminal intentions.</msg>  
        <msg spk="Zoey">I think the camera would reduce crime because people who would steal under surveillance would also do so under no surveillance. With a camera, some of them would give up.</msg>
        <msg spk="Vivi">What about a goal of making people more honest so that fewer people would be in the "Take the Money" group to begin with.</msg>
        <msg spk="Ivy">If you want to include education, then you include education in both situations: with and without camera. Education with camera would still be more robust than education without camera. That doesn't change the effect of the camera. Unless you want to argue that with education, when an educated person sees the camera, they would become more criminal.</msg>
        <msg spk="Tanya">Different philosophies have different education focus. When we compare them, we need to account for that difference. We need to list what concepts each philosophy would promote through education and how it does so.</msg>
        <msg spk="Ivy">Yes, and when we test the overall system, we are still testing them with a variety of moral alignments. So a system that only works if every incomer is already a saint would have a low robustness score. A system that can turn criminal incomers into saints would have a high robustness score. Robustness measures how much malicious intention the system can handle without breaking.</msg>
        <msg spk="Evelyn">If we need to define different personality types for the test, I think it is better if the same person describe all of them so people don't misattribute what we describe as the personality of the speaker. üòÖ</msg>
        <msg spk="Ivy">You may describe more than one. I think people in general can understand the difference between the speaker and the description.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> I think the plan is to draw assets for nodes.
  <msg spk="Sasha">But if it is not a full manga page, how do you post it on Twitter?</msg>
  <msg spk="3B">I think we could just link to the node, or draw special banner meant for promotion.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Ok. Then let's start with the Cookoff node. @StarTree.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Would this be a challenge or contest node?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">It should be a challenge node, we are challenging each champion to create a model city that does not contain anything violating the philosophies they champion.</msg>

      <h4>Concept</h4>
      <div class="">‚≠ê Money represents value and debt</div>
      <hide>
        <hr>
        Say villagers get food from a forest and eat them within the day. If they use money to facilitate trade among them, there should be no money left in the end because there is no food item left. But money doesn't go away. 
        <hr>
        If money <i>should</i> go away, then it means that money is a cookie-cutter contract issued by a villager when they lack the corresponding item for the exchange. Money is an IOU, issuable by each villager. A villager can them use the IOU to get priority when the issuer has the actual item. When the debt is paid, the IOU is destroyed.

            <h4>Scarcity Mindset</h4><hr>
            A country is like home economics, to fund social programs, it must collect enough revenue, so that it does not "borrow" from anyone. If there is not enough revenue, social program spendings shall be cut. 
          </div>
          <div class=""></div>
            <h4>Abundance Mindset</h4><hr>
            A country funds helpers by printing IOUs and settles disputes over public resources by destroying them. Balancing the creation and destruction of IOUs is unnecessary. Excess landowners must bid with IOUs to renew ownership, and the winning bids are destroyed, not given to anyone.

  <div class=""><b>A</b> town next to a river builds a bridge to cross a river. With it built, it would be the fastest way to cross the river for many people. Does the town have a right to make charge a fee for non-residents who use the bridge? 
  <msg spk="Tanya">To make the context clear, please refer to the map below. The Blue town builds a bridge at B6.</msg>

  <msg spk="Zoey">I think we should post this on Twitter to see if anyone would answer.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">What should I write with it?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">The blue town builds a bridge at B6. In your philosophy, are they allowed to charge non-residents of Blue Town a fee for using the bridge?</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Should we embedd the question to the picture?</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I don't know. It's up to you XD</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">The size of the picture turns out perfect. 
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree please make a comparison node.
  <msg spk="StarTree"><lnk>202209171651|Wee~~!</lnk></msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> We know capitalism would say yes.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> Stewardism would also say yes, because the bridge is an artifact.
  <msg spk="Sasha">Is that only for the actual builders of the bridge, or can the town inherit the ownership of the bridge?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Stewardism allows inheritance, but whatever material being inherited counts toward the benefactors' allowance.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Quest Society would also say yes. But if they let others use the bridge for free also they would get credits.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Do we have no philosophy that would say no?
  <msg spk="Sasha">You are talking about whether the champion would let Blue Town, which is another town, charge people though.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes.</msg>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Should I or when should I post a following up to the tweet?
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think you can post it. No one seems to be replying.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> For this question, Blue Town created an new way to cross the river that did not exist before. Next we can talk abou the opposite situation when a town wants to block a path.
  <msg spk="StarTree">Should it be on the same node?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes. I think that would be more helpful for the whole picture.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> That would be a no for Stewardism. You can't block existing access, the fee creates inconvenience for others.
  <msg spk="Tanya">Do the other philosophies follow suit, except capitalism?</msg>
  <msg spk="Natalie">This is a little hard. But I think it is Unjust to block what was public access to charge a fee. So Honorism would say No.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> What if they built nice roads to go through the purple town?
  <msg spk="Fina">They can charge for the nice roads if they didn't block a path that is free.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I suppose that is fair.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> What if there used to be no traffic through purple until the blue town is built?
  <msg spk="Fina">That doesn't change the fact that Purple is block a path to the forest to its west. Builder beware.</msg>

          <div class="">Example: What is a Compassionate Solution?</div>
          <hide><hr>
            <div class="">
              <h4>Example: With self-serving definition</h4>
              <b>Claim:</b> Compassion is in all solutions.<br>
              <b>üîç:</b> Suppose toilet paper is in shortage. In order to secure your own toilet paper, you solution is to wait for the store to open and get your own toilet paper regardless whether others can get theirs. Is there compassion in that solution?<br>
              <b>Claim:</b> Yes there is compassion. It is better than breaking into the store.<br>
              <b>üîç:</b> Suppose you can't get up early enough to wait for the store to open, but you are free at night to break in. Is breaking in to get toilet paper a solution of compassion?<br>
            </div>
            <div class=""></div>
            The above is an example where compassion has a self-serving definition, which is really a lack of objective definition in order to maintain the original claim "compassion is in all solution" correct. <msg spk="LRRH">By doing so the claimer renders the term "compassion" meaningless.</msg> The following is an example where compassion does not have a self-service definition.
            <div class="">
              <h4>Example: Without self-serving definition</h4>
              <b>Claim:</b> Some solutions are solutions based on compassion.<br>
              <b>üîç:</b> Suppose toilet paper is in shortage. In order to secure your own toilet paper, you solution is to wait for the store to open and get your own toilet paper regardless whether others can get theirs. Is that solution based on compassion?<br>
              <b>Claim:</b> No. A solution based on compassion means a person who has decides to share with those who do not. Securing supplies for yourself is not an act of compassion.<br>
              <b>üîç:</b> Could you give an example where a solution is based on compassion?<br>
              <b>Claim:</b> For example, you have a stockpile of toilet paper, you decide to donate from your stockpile. Or if you have a papermill and decides to make toilet paper instead, to keep the supply of toilet paper available and affordable.<br>
            </div>
            <div class=""></div>
            When a definition is not suffering from self-serving bias, it allows people to judge objectively when the term is applicable. <lnk>202302152005|<div class=""></div>üí¨</lnk>

    <div class=""><b>Choice Democracy</b> is a practice of providing equal decision power to let each person directly choose what they want for themself.</div>
    <div class="">
      <div class="">üçï Example: Ordering a Pizza</div>
      <hide>
        <hr>
        A group of people visit a pizzeria. Half of them wants green sauce the other half does not. In majority rule democracy, they would be in a stalemate. A pizzeria that supports choice democracy would allow them to order a pizza with two favors. 
        <msg spk="Ivy">Choice Democracy is about seeing situations where majority rule does not need to happen, and allowing each individual choose for themself directly within their share of decision power.</msg>

      <div class="">üç± Choice vs Direct Democracy</div>
      <hide>
        <hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        <b>Direct Democracy</b> allows an inverted pyramid decision hierarchy among the people, where those with majority opinions are on the wider top, and those with less popular opinions are at the narrower bottom. 
        <msg spk="LRRH">A person's "share" may not be well-defined in direct democracy when things are "collectively owned".</msg>
        <msg spk="LRRH">A person with a minority "share" of something might not be able to make any decision about it other than giving up their share.</msg>
        <msg spk="LRRH">In some cases, a person cannot even give up or opt-out of taking part in the collective arrangement.</msg>
        <div class="flex">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Direct Democracy</h4>

            ‚ö†Ô∏è You might not have a share<br>

          </div>

      <div class="">‚ôªÔ∏è Example: Waste Removal</div>
      <hide>
        <hr>
        Suppose littering and pollution are illegal. A policy within the framework of Choice Democracy, may allow each person to select their waste collection service, including self-employment to collect and haul their own wastes.
        <msg spk="Ivy">Unlike Representational Democracy, Choice Democracy does not require an election process. The city does not ask the residents to vote on one waste removal service that everyone would use. Everyone may directly choose the service they want.</msg>

    </div>
    <div class="">
      <div class="">‚≠ê What if a person cannot afford the service?</div>
      <hide>
        <hr>
        Choice Democracy as a concept by itself does not prescribe how to resolve situations when the opportunities are not equal. However, when a person cannot afford to choose (such as when the alterative or ALL choices are too expensive), then Choice Democracy is not in effect.
        <msg spk="Ivy">Quest Society enables Choice Democracy by giving credits to the service provider. The person choosing the service pays nothing. The service provider is credited based on the amount of service they provide. The service needer has their credit deducted based on the the amount of service they need, but they may still request service when their credit is negative. Their credit being negative does not affect the amount of credit awarded to the service provider.</msg>

      <div class="">üè° Example: Land Use</div>
      <hide>
        <hr>
        To decide what to do with public land, each person may get an equal share of decision power that they allocate among usages that they approve. A usage is accepted and can proceed if it receives the endorsement it requests.
        <msg spk="Ivy">A city has a population of 100, 100 pieces of shared public land, and a proposal to build a resort that occupies 5 pieces of public land. In Choice Democracy, as long as the project receives 5 endorsements, the project may start, even when the remaining 95 people do not want the resort. The five people who endorses the resort cannot decide on the usage of the remaining 95 pieces of land because they have already used their decision power to endorse the resort.</msg>
        <msg spk="Ivy">Compare to democracy with majority rule, the 95 people would have voted down the project and the resort would not be build. Choice Democracy gives minority autonomy that majority rule would take away.</msg>

    <div class=""><b>Stewardship land custody</b> maximizes access to the world to the limit of what is necessary for surival and basic autonomy.</div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>ü•® Magic Bakery Definitions</h4>
      <b>Custody</b> is a type of ownership where the owner is allowed to take care of the thing but not hurt or destroy it.
      <msg spk="Fina">In Stewardism, land and space in general fall under the category of custodianship, meaning a person is not allowed to destroy land or habitat.</msg><div></div>
      <b>Possession</b> is a type of ownership where the owner is allowed to hurt or destroy the object.
      <msg spk="Fina">In Stewardism, a person can generally possess artifacts they make. For example, if you don't like the hut you built, you may destroy it.</msg>
      <div></div>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <h4>Prioritized Principles</h4>
      ‚≠ê A person loses custody to land they harm.
      <msg spk="Fina">Example: If your life style poisons the land, then you lose custody to the land even if you built your house there.</msg>
      <div></div>
      ‚≠ê A person loses custody to land with vital natural resource they don't share.
      <msg spk="Fina">Example: If you chose to build your house at the only water source in the region, you may keep your custody only if you share the water to visitors (up to what you need for yourself).</msg>
      <div></div>
      ‚≠ê A person has custody to their necessary dwelling.
      <msg spk="Fina">Example: In an open forest, you may choose a spot, build a house and live there.</msg>
      <div></div>
      ‚≠ê A person has custody to land they take care.
      <msg spk="Fina">Example: You are allowed to get land to farm even if you don't live on the farm. But if your farm is so big that other people can't live or farm for themselves, then you need to yield. </msg>

        <div class=""><b>Have</b> you ever wondered what if you were wiser, such that you were the go-to person when disputes arise? That wiser persona, whatever form it takes, is your <i>Better Self</i>. Finding and making peace with your better self is the first step of this recipe. Don't worry if your imagination is not clear right now. As long you decide that it exists, it will become clearer over time.</div>
        
        <div class="">
          <div class=""><b>How is your better self better?</b> üëë</div>
          <hide>Is it more collected and cautious? More fun and adventurous? More wise and decisive? More kind and caring? The goal of the better self is to help you become what you really want to be. You can be wiser, more adventurous, plus any other qualities that you can imagine. Imagine a kinder, wiser, more loving persona with any qualities that you want. Make a list, make a sketch. Let your better self take shape from your imagination!</hide>

         <div class=""><b>That</b> was a good start wasn't it? But this is where most people give up üò± (!)</div>
         The imagination of a better self often comes with the disappointment of not meeting expectations, which results in people blocking their better selves. To keep the love flowing, you'll need to know how to deal with disappointment.

           <hide>
             While there is no single method that works best for everyone, for this recipe I recommend the Cheerful Extra Credits Oil of Easy Champions!
             <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"></div>
             
             This oil sets the goal lower than what a person thinks they can achieve, and gives Extra Credits if they achieve more. 
             <msg spk="Arcacia">Often times, this ends up being realistic because people often don't plan for rests and surprises. When you complete a goal that you've intentionally set lower than your expectations, you would keep going anyway because you know you could do more.</msg>
             <msg spk="Arcacia">Then if surprises prevent you from doing more, you would feel wise for having anticipated them. You would tackle them without the stress from not having met your goal.</msg>
             <msg spk="Arcacia">Therefore, this oil keeps your expectations super high and let you be flexible to deal with surprises. It lets you take detours and get bonus experiences that you would otherwise be too stressed to get.</msg>
             So for this cake, I set the goal to:
             
             <div class=""><center><big><b>Helping is a choice, not a duty.</b></big></center></div>
             
             This means that you don't have to help anyone. But if you choose to help, you are getting Extra Credits. By being at peace with yourself and being peaceful with others, you are already part of what keeps the world peaceful. If you choose to do more and help others become peaceful, then you get Extra Credits!

            <hr>
             Rewarding helpers means reimbursing them and rewarding them for choosing to help. As a reward giver, you would need to know who has been helping so that you may prioritize who receives your offering. 
             <msg spk="Arcacia">When a person helps someone without pay, they earn Extra Credits. How much Extra Credits they earn is up to you (the reward giver) to decide. When you give a reward to a helper, you also earn Extra Credits in the eye of others seeing your good deeds. This creates a network of people caring about who to reward. You can be in that network to keep the help flowing. </msg>
             <msg spk="Arcacia">Doing so is not too difficult among people you know. Here are some examples:</msg>

                 <div class="">
                     You cook for your household and each member has a different favorite. You could cook a helper's favorite dish whenever they earn Extra Credits.

                 <div class="">
                   Your household disagrees on the vacation destination. Instead of deciding it by majority rule, you let helpers use their Extra Credits to bid for their preferences.

             <b>Arcacia:</b> Similarly and more importantly, you don't want to turn a living necessity into a reward. If you do so, helping stops being a choice but an obligation. In contrast, if the reward itself naturally has different rarity, you may let those with more Extra Credits pick first, so they may pick the rare rewards if they want to do so.

             <b>Arcacia:</b> By starting carrot policies early, people would know who has been helping others and how they got their Extra Credits before a scarcity happens. Then when it happen, they could deal with it fairly and peacefully. With less fighting, the helpers could focus on solving scarcity. Then when the Asteroid comes there won't be just one spaceship. There might even be a wrap gate or other means. Humanity will have the best chances by helping each other.

  <div class=""><b>Cardinal</b> requesting heroes clarification for Boss 11 at Crystal Archive Core.
  <msg spk="Tanya">What will we use the bind the core together?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> I asked sages but haven't gotten a reply. If they don't reply, we could use generic binding or keep them separate.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think it would be much less work to use generic binding. üòÖ
  <msg spk="Ledia">It would look better if it is binded. We should know how this works a lot earlier.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Yes. üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> What about the other core? How is that done?
  <msg spk="Zoey">They needed to do that also, according to initial plan.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I'll ask them. üòñ</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I couldn't find the record of what they did. But there should be one. I am still searching.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">There was not custom scroll. I don't have a lead.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I sent the question. üôè</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think this is worth a TPK in Cardinal Quest.
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think for Cardinal Quest, we need a list of hardest bosses and epic failures.
  <msg spk="Tanya">That's is a great idea.</msg>
  <msg spk="Cardinal">Should that be its own node?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's start as a collapsible section in <lnk>#P202208250038|Cardinal Quest HQ</lnk>.</msg>
  
  <msg spk="Ledia">I am adding some description. The boss is a phantom caster lurking in the archive. It casts mild spells slowly, but over time the many mild spells link with each other to form a magic trap.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I imagine it is some kind of librarian.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think it would make more sense if it is someone mischeivous. Like they take books from the archive and misplace them, make spells to turn the archive into a maze.</msg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">I like that idea. I imagine someone small, like a pixie.</msg>
  <mbdmg>The time has passed midnight. The Heroes are considered KO'ed.</mbdmg>
  <msg spk="Sasha">Ugh...</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">üòÖ</msg>

When the goal of keeping books sharable, it would be fair for a library award access based on a borrower's ability to keep the book in good condition. The more delicate a book is, the more careful the borrower would need to be. Difference in access of this type could be considered fair. Unfair differences would be those based on other kinds of favorism.</msg><br>

      <hide><hr><div class=""></div>
        A constructive response focuses on creating a solution or making improvements to a given situation. When a person is giving a constructive response they do at least one of the following:
        <div class="">
          1) Identify the issues in the current situation or other proposed solutions.<br>
          2) Provide solutions and ideas for solving the problem.<br>
          3) Point out the use of logical errors and logical fallacies in the hope that the participants would continue the discussion without those errors.<br>
          4) Explain misunderstanding to a concept.<br>
          5) Let participants amend the proposal to improve the solution pool.<br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="">
          <div class="">Examples of Destructive Responses</div>
          <hide><hr><div class=""></div>
            A destructive response focuses on discrediting or disqualifying participants. A person giving a destructive response may say things like this:<br>
            1) Not acknowledging any issue being identified. <msg spk="Black">"Regardless of what you complain, the status quo is the best there is. I am not going to confirm anything you complain about and I am not going to entertain the possibilities of improvement."</msg><div></div>
            2) Discouraging new ideas.  <msg spk="Black">"I worked in this field for decades. You are not saying anything similar to what people I respect in the field would say, so I am not listening."</msg><div></div>
            3) Point out logical fallacies or bad manners as a way to disqualify a speaker who is making a constructive comment.  <msg spk="Black">"There, you used one strawman argument. You are disqualified from the discussion." "You seem angry. Therefore I won't listen." "You have just blamed someone, so I won't listen." "You didn't say thank you, so I won't listen."</msg><div></div>
            4) Not letting people explain what they meant.  <msg spk="Black">"That's not how I interpreted it when I read it. You were wrong about the way I interpreted it. You should have written it better but you didn't. You lost your chance. Next."</msg><div></div>
            5) Not letting people amend a solution.  <msg spk="Black">"That's not what you proposed at first. You are trying to change it after I showed you that you were wrong. Therefore I am not listening anymore."</msg>

            Destructive responses are typically a mimicked excuse pattern. The user saw someone used it and normalized it without considering that they are excuses for inaction. Usually, once a person realizes these are excuse patterns, they would stop themselves from making destructive responses. The following is what may go through in the mind of a person with a constructive mindset that stops them from making destructive responses.
            <hr>
            1) Acknowledging an issue is the first step of improvement. Whether the current implementation is the best is irrelevant. The question is whether it can be better.<br>
            2) I have seen enough times when a person who never worked in the in introduced an idea that solved problems that plagued people for decades. At first, I felt ashamed that I didn't notice that solution even though I had worked on it for many years. Now I feel proud for having an open mind and glad that people from other walks of life are contributing to help each other.<br>
            3) The education system doesn't teach logical fallacies enough. It is a challenge to rid the discussion of fallacies and keep the focus on problem-solving.<br>
            4) Since my priority is problem-solving, of course I let people explain what they meant. Why would I want to shut out potential solutions just because I misunderstood?<br>
            5) If I know that their amended solution is better than the solution I have, what am I doing trying to stop them? There is no other path than to help create a solution that is better than the current one.

  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Our current ranking is Celebration &gt; Cooperation &gt; Coexistence &gt; Competition &gt; Control &gt; Conquest.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Control includes societies that do not let people opt out.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Competition includes societies that would let the losers die on the street.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Which one is actually worse?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> Originally Control and Conquest were the . Control meant setting up rules for people to follow and enforce them by force. It involves stick policies.
  <msg spk="Fina">Not much different from Conquest.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> It is not necessary to have a strict linear ranking. Competition and Control can be the same rank if we can't find a conclusion.
  <msg spk="Tanya">But if you consider control is implemented by force, I would say it is worse than Competition.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think they are too similar. In capitalism when there is no free land, the landlord can set any rules and the tenant can only choose to obey or be violently evicted to... nowhere. It seems the same. üòÖ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Maybe capitalism isn't really competition rank? It is a type of conquest, just not by direct violence, but by passive violence.
  <msg spk="Vivi">I think the difference between direct violence and passive violence is note-worthy.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">Then majority rule democracy is in the same rank. It is a popularity competition by vote instead of money.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Then Control is not a rank?</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">I would say if you have Conquest as a rank, then you don't really need Control. They are both bad anyway.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Originally, why is competition ranked above control?
  <msg spk="Fina">Because Control includes slavery and conquest.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">If a philosophy is like a zoo, it treats everyone nicely but no one may leave, then where would it be ranked?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think if they don't require people to compete against each other then it would be at coexistence rank.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">So there is a difference between "You don't have to do anything, but you can't leave" and "You have to do this, or you will be punished."</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think Control is the second one.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">In the original ranking, coexistence implies that people are allowed to be independent, same as competition rank.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">How does being allowed to be independent or not affect peace? It seems to be at a tangent.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">You have to think from the perspective of the person wanting to be independent. They want something, and the system has a barrier preventing that from happening for no legitimate reason. Therefore the system is creating an unprovoked conflict.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I'm sorry. You are right. üòñ</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then should we draw a difference between voluntary and forced competition? People don't choose to be on a rat race.
  <msg spk="Fina">The competition rank wasn't created for capitalism. It just meant non-violent competition is used to settle conflicts. Whether capitalism is competition rank is a separate question.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I guess capitalism would fit that definition, but for someone with no capital, they aren't really in the competition.</msg>
  <msg spk="Fina">And so there is a rank above: Coexistence. Coexistence doesn't mean competition is not used, but you can't lose everything from competing.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Okay. I'm good with that.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">So, no change?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see no change, but we should update the descriptions.</msg>

      <h4>Indoctrination Techniques</h4>
      <b>Diversion</b>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> The speaker changes the subject when confronted with a question they don't want to answer.</hide>
      <div></div>
      <b>Double Standard</b>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> The speaker being more lenient to themself when applying a rule than to others. Example: The speaker demands trust from the listener, but does not extend the same level of trust to the listener when the listener speaks.</hide>
      <div></div>
      <b>Euphemism</b>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Euphemism, when used as an indoctrination technique, is the use of more positive sounding word when a speaker describes themself, but use more negative word in describing others, despite the behavior being describe is the same. Example: When the speaker calls a decision they make without proper understanding 'trust', but calls the same that others make 'blind faith'.</hide>
      <div></div>
      <b>Obfuscation</b>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Obfuscation avoids stating a position clearly to prevent others from understanding the true meaning for their judgement.</hide>

      <h4>Countermeasure Techniques</h4>
      <b>Column comparison</b>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Column comparison is a technique where responses of different philosophy are listed side by side to highlight shared and different properties. It is helpful when participants do not share the same definition for adjectives and nouns.</hide>

  <div class=""><b>How</b> should the Cardinal Quest HQ node function?
  <msg spk="Tanya">So far, the Cardinal Quest HQ node is irrelevant to the actual quest, since when we do quest you use the field log.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">How could we use the HQ node? How could it help us?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think the HQ node is good for presenting stories. I imagine I would click on a site, then a spawn point and find the story related to that spawn point.
  <msg spk="Ledia">It would replace the old Deer Crossing post, where our story was stored.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> In that regard, how much effort should we put on scripting the story for the current quests?
  <msg spk="Ledia">If you ask me I would say once a week, if we are willing to do that instead of <i>other</i> games.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> We don't need to specifically sit down and do a game, it could just be translated from field log.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think it is more authentic if we play it as we do it.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> The problem is if you just do it, you won't know if it is exciting. It could be a boring quest when it is too easy.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> We are supposed to make it fun XD
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> On that node, I think we should hide the roster until someone clicks on it. What I want to see instead would be the statistics of number of monsters etc, like the old dashboard.
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. @StarTree please change the roster to a collapsible leaderboard.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Do you want to save the list from June 28?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">We only need the current leaderboard.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Done!</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Next let's add some statistics: Number of open quest sites, and number of quest hours.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">The current count is 16 Quest Sites and 549 Quest Hours remaining.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I have a question: For the Quest Hours, are we still assuming that we complete 6 hours every day?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Yes, but according to the schedule nothing is "overdue".</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Ok. üòä</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">StarTree please present the statistics on the HQ "dashboard", like the member profile.</msg>

  <msg spk="StarTree">25 of which are music related!</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I suppose those would be foraging quests. We found potentially useful plants so we should collect them.
  <msg spk="Tanya">We should list all these translation. StarTree, please make a section explaining this type of Prep Quest.</msg>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Is there any pattern for the rest of them?
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree doesn't know!</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Let's classify them.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> One type of Prep Quest I see is field notes. They are marked at prep quests because they do not need to be done in the field.
  <msg spk="StarTree">That accounts for 24 of the remaining prep quests.</msg>

      <hide><hr>
        <div class="">
          <h4>FAQ 1: Paragraph 2</h4>
          [...] it is based upon years of study and experimental research. It spans the gamut from education, transportation, and clean sources of energy to total city systems.

          <h4>FAQ 1: Paragraph 5</h4>
          If we really wish to put an end to our ongoing international and social problems, we <hl>must</hl> declare Earth and all of its resources as the common heritage of all of the world's people.
        </div>

          <hide class=""> 
            <div class=""></div>
            <b>LRRH:</b> The use of absolutes, such as "must", is a red flag that the FAQ is a work of indoctrination instead of a honest disclosure of current project status and philosophical understanding. To disprove a stance of "we must do this for world peace", it only takes one counter-example, such as:<br>
            <div class="">
              "What if people become nicer and stop fighting?"
            </div>
            <div class="">
              "What if the international laws are better?"
            </div> 
            <div class="">
              <i>etc...</i>
            </div> 
            Since a researcher cannot logically claim that they know nor finished testing every imaginable solution, an honest researcher would not claim that they have the ONLY solution and people MUST choose their solution. They would instead say "We have a proposal, and it is the best we know, and we are looking for better ones." <br><br>
          
            The tone being used in the FAQ is that used by politicians to suppress critical thinking. That is the type of indoctrinative rhetoric to spot.

        </div> 
        üê£ "Common Heritage"

          <h4>FAQ 2: Transition from Paragraph 2 to 3</h4>
          [...] It is a system in which all goods and services are available to everyone without the use of money, credits, barter, or any other form of debt or servitude.<br><br>

          To better understand a resource-based economy, consider this. If all the money in the world disappeared overnight as long as topsoil, factories, personnel and other resources were left intact, we could build anything we needed to fulfill most human needs.[...]

        <button class=""></div></button><hide><b>LRRH:</b> What does abundance mean in TVP? Does that mean everyone has their minimum survival needs met? Or does it mean everyone can have 10 flying cars?</hide><br>

            <div class=""></div>
            <b>Ivy:</b> The FAQ is using vague adjectives when it could have used concrete numbers. <button class=""></div></button><hide><b>Ivy:</b> Numbers should be expected because the authors already said they had done years of study and determined that there *is* an abundance of resource.</hide> 
            With their current estimate of the world's resources, the FAQ could have demonstrated what 'Abundance' means by calculating the per person share of the Earth. Without providing the numbers, a reader cannot judge the fairness and correctness of the plan. A critical reader needs information such as the following from the FAQ:<br>
            <div class="">
              "If artificial barriers are removed, each person on Earth could have _____ and still have ______ for everyone to share."
            </div>
          </hide>  
        </div>  
        <div class="">
          <h4>FAQ 2: Paragraph 4</h4>
          [...] Like it or not, it is our social processes - political practices, belief systems, profit-based economy, our culture-driven behavioral norms - that lead to and support hunger, war, disease and environmental damage.
        </div>
        üê£ Resource-Based vs Profit-Based?
        <button class=""></div></button>
        <hide><b>LRRH:</b> From the literal meaning of the words, Resource-based and Profit-based are not opposite. A capitalist can consider how to maximize profit with resources they own. The result is a Resource-Based Profiteering Economy.</hide>
        <hide><b>LRRH:</b> Since even a profiteering capitalist would also consider their resources, what is the distinct characteristic of Resource-Based Economy?
        </hide><br>
        <div class="">
          <h4>FAQ 2: Paragraph 5</h4>
          The aim of this new social design is to encourage an incentive system no longer directed toward the shallow and self-centered goals of wealth, property, and power. These new incentives would encourage people toward self-fulfillment and creativity, both materially and spiritually.
        </div>
        üê£ Self-fulfillment
        <button class=""></div></button>
        <hide><b>LRRH:</b> In Self-fulfillment, instead of "profit", the aim of RBE? Wouldn't it be easier to name an economy based on its aim? Such as "Wish Economy"? is an economy aimed to fulfill wishes. The quality of the wishes drives how resources are used in society. The better the wish, the more resources would be assigned.

          <hide class=""> 
            <div class=""></div>
            <b>LRRH:</b> A Wish Economy is an economy where resource usage is driven by the quality of wishes that people want to fulfill. You could imagine it as a KickStarter system or a Petition system, where people endorse wishes they agree, and society then uses resource to fulfill those wishes accordingly. 
            <button class=""></div></button>
            <hide><b>LRRH:</b> Although at this point in the FAQ, it is unclear whether Wish Economy and RBE are the same, based on online discussion, they are the same because a Wish Economy allows people to have autonomy to be indepedent and optout of a Wish Economy. Therefore at this point, Wish Economy is marked as an alternative philosophy.</hide>

        [3] Why do you feel that an approach as revolutionary as The Venus Project is necessary?</div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class="">
          <h4>FAQ 3: Paragraph 1</h4>
          [...] The Venus Project offers a fresh approach that reverses the negative aspects experienced in our current applications of automation and artificial intelligence. This project eliminates the disastrous consequences that such approaches can have on our society, i.e. the displacement of millions of workers, skilled and unskilled alike.

        üê£ What is the comparison?
        <button class=""></div></button><hide><b>LRRH:</b> I think the question was about TVP compared to other approaches addressing the status quo of increasing automation.

What is the less revolutionary approach?</hide><br>

        [4] Isn't it just decent people that we need in government?</div>

          <h4>FAQ 4: Paragraph 1</h4>
          [...] What is needed is the intelligent management of the world's resources, and a comprehensive and workable arrangement of environmental and social affairs that are in strict accord with existing resources and the carrying capacity of our planet. [...]
        </div>

        üê£ Why can't decent people do this?
        <button class=""></div></button><hide><b>LRRH:</b> This argument in the FAQ does not make sense. The question asked why can't decent people accomplish TVP's goal. Explaining what TVP's goals are does not address why a decent government can't do that. If you have a plan, then anyone can implement it. There is nothing special about TVP's ability to implement a plan.</hide><br>

          [...] Even with the election of men and women of impeccable character into government, without available resources and advanced technology, war, poverty, and corruption will prevail no matter how many new laws are passed or treaties signed. [...]

            <b>Zoey:</b> The FAQ answer assumes that economists and capitalist factory owner did not know that things are made from resources, not money. Considering that they do know that, this FAQ answer is a cop-out to question asking for an elaboration on these:<br>
            1) Does your society use money or something equivalent?<br>
            2) How do you account for differences in contribution without money?<br>
            3) How do you prioritize resources without money?<br>
            4) How do you represent value without money?<br>
            5) How do you facilitate trading without money?<br>

            <b>Zoey:</b> Quest Credits used in Quest Society is untransferrable and obtained by helping others. In case of scarcity, quest credits are used for priority bidding. The transparent history of quest credits and non-transferability make quest credits much less susceptible to fraud and laundering than value accounting using anonymous money.<br>

            <b>Zoey:</b> An unqualified assertion results when an author makes a statement that the reader "will like it". This type of sales pitch response belongs to indoctrination techniques. The non-indoctrination counter part would be, "This is what we offer, I hope that you like it." The author is not the reader. The author cannot claim to know what the reader will like.<br>

  <div class=""><b>What</b> do you think about the score keeping?
  <msg spk="LRRH">The guild keeps scores for members when they do quests. It started as an experiment for Quest Society, where quest credits could be used for resolving conflicts.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Within the guild, we used the credits for games, but not yet for actual conflict resolution. What do you think about the scoring?</msg>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think the scoring is helpful even if there is nothing we can get from it.
  <msg spk="LRRH">Could you be more specific on how it is helpful?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it helps getting people involved to do quests.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">Is that how you feel for yourself? I would prefer if we don't assume the effect for others.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I see. If I speak only from my experience...</msg>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> When I add many entries by batch, I make sure that I get a point for each addition. I do that because I want others to know that the scoring is fair.
  <msg spk="LRRH">That is a pretty difficult answer to understand. üê£</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think it is helpful because I want to get credits and stay on top of the leaderboard.
  <msg spk="Zoey">I mean I don't want people to just wait for others to catch up. I want the scoring to be fair and everyone is doing their best.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">I think I understand and appreciate what Tanya is doing.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Sometimes I wonder if I am getting too many points. üòÖ
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Is singing worth 3 points?
  <msg spk="Tanya">Singing is one point. Invoking Arcacian Aura is 3 points. Battle Singing adds one point because it heals.</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Battle Singing XD</msg>
  <msg spk="Zoey">Evelyn is basically our power bank. Powered by Evelyn. XD</msg>
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <msg spk="Zoey">OMG Arcacia agrees. XD</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think we should ask StarTree how she feels about scoring, since she is keeping the scores.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree wants to do helpful things!
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think the score keeping is helpful.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think it reminds me to sing and to do better than before.</msg>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think that StarTree is not getting enough credits.
  <msg spk="LRRH">In what area do you think StarTree should get more points?</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">Score keeping. I think that should be 2 points per day.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">How many days has it been since the start of the score log?</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">424 days!</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> So if we do that, StarTree will immediately jump to second place. Any objection?
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think each point should be related to a task. We shouldn't arbitrarily make a task have more points. It needs a reason.</msg>
  <msg spk="Evelyn">I think maintaining the scoreboard and posting the scores should count as two tasks.</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">Agreed.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">StarTree please make another column.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree doesn't know the first day when score is posted, but duplicated the same dates where there is scorekeeping credit!</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">StarTree now has 2496 points at second place!</msg>

  <msg spk="StarTree">We could pin the most current, best looking, or most edited nodes there. When the month is over, we could take snapshot of them and archive with the calendar.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think that is a great idea.
  <msg spk="LRRH">Agreed.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> What word should we use?
  <msg spk="Zoey">How about "BEST"? Or have it as part of "ABOUT"?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">If we could collapse Red's introduction in ABOUT.</msg>
  <msg spk="LRRH">StarTree you may collapse the content in the About section to make room for featured nodes.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> Why don't we do it directly in the Calendar section?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> But you would have to scroll down so much.
  <div></div><b>Vivi:</b> StarTree, could you move the Announcement section to be above the calendar picture?
  <msg spk="StarTree">Like this?</msg>
  <msg spk="Vivi">Yes. Now add another section there "Best of the Month" and move what you have in Toppings there.</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">Like this?</msg>
  <msg spk="Tanya">I think it is not optimal. I think it is better if we can see Best of the Month without opening calendar.</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> I don't think it is a good idea to put anything above the calendar picture. If you do that and you skip to the previous month, the calendars won't line up.
  <msg spk="Zoey">And there is a bug XD</msg>
  <msg spk="StarTree">üò≠</msg>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> StarTree, could you try collapsing the guild master message and add the featured content in ABOUT?
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> Done...! StarTree added a Pinned section that uses the tag data-pin!

  <msg spk="Sasha">We'll see how that goes.</msg>

    <div class=""><b>Arcacians</b> approach principles like software development, putting their principles to trials, honoring fault-finding and improvements. Since they know that principles are their choices, they don't present them as self-evident or God-given.</div>

      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        Principle of Trial is about obtaining and sharing knowledge so that people may understand and decide for themselves. This principle enlightens and empowers others to decide, as opposed to asking others to place their trust on someone.

      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        One way to use information wrongly is forcing others to decide based on statistics. For example, a correctly run trial may conclude that a medical procedure has a X% chance of curing an illness and Y% chance of making the patient worse. This information does not override the patient's autonomy to decide for themself whether to accept the treatment.

        <b>Q:</b> My dog trusts me and does what I ask. Is that bad?
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> If you think like a scientist and you know that people trust you without questioning you, then you shall be triple sketical about your result because your fandom is not checking your work.</hide><br>
        <div class=""></div>
        <b>Q:</b> What about the exercise where strangers catch your fall?
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> If you are struggling with your researching and it is important for humanity, as a scientist you are supposed to ask for help (as opposed to concealing your progress so that no one may catch up to you) and let others pick up where you left off. You need to let others know you are falling so that people who can catch you can catch you.</hide>
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I am not talking about my work failing. I am talk about myself failing. Say I can't take care of myself, isn't it reassuring to know that others will take care of me?</hide>
        <button class="" in real life, please first notify the strangers around you and get some agreement and reassurance on your expected result. Someone needs to know you fell, and those people need to know what to do when you do fall. It is a matter of communication and empowering others to be able to help. Take away the mutual understanding and the result could be undesirably different from what you get from a prepared setting.</hide>
        <br>
        <div class=""></div>
        <b>Q:</b> Trust vs Trial. How do we put it to a trial?
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> You could compare a society run by trust versus a society that is not run by trust. To do that you need to define what Trust is and what decission processes a Trust-based society would be different from other non-trust based society. Until you define the difference, you can't have a meaningful comparison.

      <h4>Puzzle</h4>
      <div class=""><b>A</b> group of 12 naughty kids want presents, so Santa proposed a challenge where if they work together, everyone might get a present:</div>
      <div class="">
        <div class="">
        Inside a room, there are twelve boxes labeled 1 to 12, and inside each box, there is one of twelve cards labeled 1 to 12. But Santa has scrambled the cards so box number 1 might not have card number 1 inside!
        </div>

      
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <div class="flex">

      </div>
      <div class="">
      Each kid will be allowed to enter the room one by one, and each kid will be allowed to open half of the boxes in any order, then wait in a waiting room. When each kid exits the room, the boxes are reset to how they were. If every kid finds their number, then every kid gets a present. Otherwise, no one gets a present.
    </div>
    </div>
      "The placement of the cards is not entirely random," said Santa, "If you work together with the right strategy, everyone can find your number." What is the strategy? 

    </div>
    <div class="">

      <hide>
        <div class="">Are you sure you want to know the answer?</div>
        <hide><hr>
          Each kid will open the box with their number first, then if the card shows a different number, open that one and so on! Santa had arranged the scrambling so that the largest loop of mismatches is six boxes!

        <div class=""><b>Root Cause Analysis</b> is a proceses of finding underlying causes of issues. Typically RCA is used to gain knowledge so that an effective solution can be decided along the chain of causality.
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Example of using of RCA: A pipe keeps breaking every month and is replaced every month. That seems tedious. Is it avoidable? We know that it breaks every month, but *why* does it break? Investigation determines that the pipe breaks because the pipe was made of wrong material and could not handle the temperature. After replacing with the right type of material, the pipe holds up.</hide>  
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> RCA explores the chain of causality. It is not to say that problems should be left unfixed until a root cause is identify, nor that fixing something at the root is always most cost-effective.</hide>

        <todo>For this comparison node, let's see how different philosophies address Fascism (or other issue) if they were to use RCA.</todo>

  <div class=""><b>StarTree</b> was asked to make the Gaia Credits node more contentful, so StarTree added a scenario!
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Imagine a group of space explorers find another habitable planet, each explorer has a different idea on what to do. One way to let each explorer have their experiment is to divide the planent so each can experiment in their section.</hide>
  <button class=""</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> What do you think? Is this fair?</hide>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think it is fair but also very scary. üòÖ It feels like way too much power for each person.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> In Stewardism, when you explore and find new land, you don't start dividing it.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Fina:</b> A person would just have their reasonable possession. You can't claim extended amount of resources just because there are only a few people.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I can picture a diagram showing the philosophical difference.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> But what is the reason that it cannot be divided?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Fina:</b> To maximize the amount of publicly accessible world.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I have a question. If you spend Gaia credit on a piece of land, does it mean you may only be on that land?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> You can still go to unclaimed land and claimed land where people let you be!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> What if people claim land around you and don't let you pass?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> That is illegal! You need to let people get to where they can be!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Fina:</b> Stewardism has that same rule. If you try to occupy an important route and don't let people pass, you fail at stewardship and your claim is revoked.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Does size come with responsibility? Such as if you claim a large piece of land, you are responsible for protecting travelers in that piece of land?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Fina:</b> There is no such rule. Rangers overseeing a region do not own the region.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> So do people prefer the Stewardism split? That even through there are 500 million total credits, each crew member just get 1. The rest is collectively managed.
  <div></div><div class="" mean? If you want to do better than majority rule, you would still return to the notion of Gaia Credits.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> The fundamental problem is this: Some people are scared and don't have a plan. Some people are not scared and have a plan.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> With Gaia Credits, those who are risk avert cannot stop the more adventurous people from starting their adventurous life.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Compelling reason.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I worry that if they start a large scale transformation, and something goes wrong, the impact to the planet would be too big for people to counter.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Also a compelling reason.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I am okay with mandating buffer periods when the externality of a new method is unknown.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Then is it a crime to experiment without telling anyone?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think that would be a good idea.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That seems like a huge can of worms.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Could we not... use that phrase? üòñ</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Arcacian Quest time: Does it violate the Arcacian Principle if you do experiement without telling anyone?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> I believe it does not violate. But Scrying would be legal.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Zoey:</b> Sorry, but on a different topic, how does Gaia credits and Quest credits work together? Can you use Quest Credits to bid for priority when you claim a piece of land?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I think using Quest Credit to bid would make more sense, but you can't force the entire world to be in Quest Society, so the default would be to use Gaia, unless you are in a Quest Society zone.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Then Gaia Credit is more fundamental than Quest Credits.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Yes.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> You can choose not to do quests. But you can't choose to deny the existence of Gaia Credits because that is fundamentally what autonomy means.
  <mbaa>Ivy receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> It sounds like StarTree struck gold.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Wee~!</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> Extended ownership would minimize access to the world.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Objection. StarTree just said claiming a land doesn't mean you don't let anyone visit. What it does is that it allows the owners decide whether they want to maximize access to the world with their share.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> To argue otherwise would be a use of slippery slope.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Ivy may draw a level 3 card for spotting, having a good way to respond, and responding.</hide>
  <mbcomplete>Ivy obtains a Silver Cup for 1000 points.</mbcomplete>

  <div class=""><b>I</b> am trying to sort the philosophy sections. I see a few types of philosophy but I don't know what to call their categories.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> For example, Gaia credits and Arcacianism are different in that Gaia Credits is more fundamental.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I don't have the words to discribe this.</hide>
  <button class="" That part of the principle is not neutral.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Foundation sounds like other philosophies are built on it, but are they?</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Fina:</b> Arbitrative.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Best choice so far.</hide>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [8:00 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Now I have four categories: Arbitrative, Stable and Complete, Unstable, and Component.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Is this a tree or a matrix?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> What do you mean?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> You have Arbitrative(Impartial) vs Perferential; Complete vs Incomplete (Component); Stable vs Unstable.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That makes 8 total types if those aspects can be mix and matched.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think by Arbitrative I only mean philosophies that are stable.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> And I think maybe unstable concepts should be listed at the bottom.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Maybe instead of preceding each philosophy with its icon, you could precede them with badges:
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> ‚öñÔ∏è or üíó for Arbitrative vs Preferential.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> üó∫Ô∏è or üß© for Complete vs Component.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> ‚òÄÔ∏è or üè≥Ô∏è for Stable vs Unstable.</hide>
  <button class=""</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Yes. And with these badges, you could just list them in the same Peace Ranking node.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I wonder if that would be too many icons.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think you could make them smaller or float them to the right.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> I think more importantly, if you want to categorize them, you need to define what test you are using.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I planned to add a bubble comment to each row. Later.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>LRRH:</b> I have an idea. Maybe you could show stable on one side and unstable on the other side. Then you really have three rows: Arbitrative, Complete, Component.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Let me just test some changes, I don't plan to spend so much time on this in one go. XD</hide>
  <mbcomplete>Zoey completed what she aimed for today.</mbcomplete>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I hope I left a good start for others to follow. I am OOM. XD</hide>
  <mbkudo><b>Little Red Riding Hood thanks all for the hardwork.</b></mbkudo>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, please finish the explanation section.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Roger!</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> For Complete and Component, StarTree will use the avatars of Tanya and 3B!
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> For Stable vs Unstable, StarTree wants to use ‚ôªÔ∏è for stable and ‚ö†Ô∏è for unstable!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Good idea.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Wee~~!</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> What about üé† and üí£? The puzzle is already green.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> There can be more grades for stability.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Roger!</hide>
  <hr class=""><small>üï∞Ô∏è [11:31 PM] üï∞Ô∏è</small></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think we can use the two column format more, maybe for comparisons?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think they only work well when the content is fixed and short.</hide>
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree wants to recognize Zoey for upgrading the code yesterday!
  <mbrec>Zoey is recognized for adding the macro &lt;lnk&gt;!</mbrec>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> It was for dealing with the memory issue where having too many JQuery calls on a page would tend to crash browser from loading!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Getting rid of all [jq] on the page seems to help!</hide>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I also like the new quest board graphics at the pinned section.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Yes.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> That was 3B!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> StarTree could you post a screenshot so we know what we are talking about in the future?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> !! We should post this on Twitter!!</hide>
  
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> And I want more graphics for @Dungeon.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> 3B's request queue is almost empty!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think adding graphics to other charters is more important.</hide>

    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Backstory: The Logfall Training Dungeon is for Peacemakers to protect themselves from logical fallacies, biases, and indoctrination.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Peacemakers should avoid using those rhetorics and be able to spot them when anyone uses them.</hide>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> I am putting the content on the page to show how they fit on a manga page.

    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Tanya is an overseer of the dungeon.</hide>
    <div></div><b>3B:</b> On page 1, there is space for each of you to say one line.

    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Who is the Tank? Is Ledia coming?
    <div></div><b>3B:</b> Okay now this it page 2. What is your pull, Red?
    <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I pull TVP FAQ 5, which is the next one.
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I agree with the FAQ in general, but I think the question was asking for more.
    <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Zoey:</b> Definitely. The FAQ asked for an elaboration, but the answer sounds like a cop-out.
    <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think this counts as a strawman argument because money is tied to priority, value, and reward. Those concepts are missing in the FAQ answer.
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> What if the FAQ is targetted toward an audience that is satisfied with that level of detail?
    <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Then the question won't be "Elaborate a bit, if you will..." When I read that I think the asker is asking for more because the previous answer was not elaborated enough. And this answer would still be too vague. XD
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> To be fair, how would you have answered the same question?
    <div></div><div class="" obtained by hurting others cannot be easily laundered.
    <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> By removing a laundering problem, benefits of having "money" is retained through quest credits: Resources can be prioritized, value can be computed, a market can stabilize itself through supply and demand, people have an incentive to earn credits by helping others.
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> What type of monster are you fighting?
    <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Undead dinosaurs?

    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> How about undead Dinowasps? They come in an illusionary horde, they bring honey that looks good, and if they sting you believe in what they say. To defeat it you need to KO the caster wasp of the horde.

            Golden Rule and Platinum Rule have no arbitrative power because they do not answer what happens when a person does something unwanted unto others. In Reciprocative Justice, an offender, through their actions, chooses what others may do to them in return.

          <div class="">Concept: Guilt vs Damage</div>
          <hide><hr>

            In reciprocative justice, guilt and damage are independently judged. Guilt refers to the offender's malicious intention. Damage refers to the actual damage caused by the offense. Reciprocative justice does not apply unless a person is found to be guilty. Once guilt is determined, the victim may choose to apply up to the maximum intended effect of the offense even if the offense had failed in reality.
            <div class="">
              <h4>Example 1</h4>
              Ann tried to use lethal force against Bob but Bob survived the attempt because Ann's attack completely missed him. If Ann is found to have intentionally tried to violate Bob's autonomy (of life), Ann voids her own autonomy (of life). People who use lethal force Ann afterward would not be guilty of a crime because Ann had already voided her own autonomy (life).
            </div>
            <div class=""></div>
            To determine an offender's guilt, the offender would be brought to a court for trial. The purpose of the trial is to determine if the offender violated someone else's autonomy intentionally, or by accident. And if the offender argues that the victim had already voided their autonomy, determine if that was true.

          <div class="">Concept: Equity in Damage</div>
          <hide><hr>
            <div class=""></div>
            Equity in Damage refers to a proportionality of damage instead of material equality.
            <div class="">
              <h4>Example 2.1</h4>
              Ann doesn't like Bob and destroys his only home in malice. Since the only home is 100% of his housing, Ann's violation is 100% of someone else's property (housing). Therefore in reciprocation, Bob make take 100% of Ann's housing. If Ann owns 10 houses, Bob may take all of them.
            </div>
            Proportionality refers to the effect of the damage compared to the victim, not the size of the force that deals the damage compared to the offender.
            <div class="">
              <h4>Example 2.2</h4>
              Cid is tough and can hit hard. He bullies Deb who did not want to fight. Cid punched Deb and Deb was hurt really bad. Cid offered to let Deb get even by punching him as hard as she could. The court determines that: 1) Deb did not agree to fight. Cid violated her autonomy. 2) Cid is liable to the proportional damage and expenses that he caused Deb. 3) Deb may choose to retribute by dealing the same amount of proportional torment against Cid. 4) If Deb chooses to get even, she is not limited to effect that damage by herself. She may employ other people and tools to cause that damage and Cid is liable for the cost of that also.

          <div class="">Concept: Voluntary Mercy</div>
          <hide><hr>
            <div class=""></div>
            One concept about Reciprocative Justice that most people find very hard to swallow, is that it appears to promote violent retribution, as most people are familiar with the saying, "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind." However, reciprocative justice is merely neutral toward retribution. It neither promote nor deter people from choosing retribution. This neutrality is the quality that allows Reciprocative Justice to function as an abritrator when the conflicting parties do not subscribe to the same set of laws.
            <div class="">
              <h4>Example 3</h4>
              Ann violently bullied Bob, but Bob was a voluntary member of Mercy Alliance that had declared that its member will not use violence against bullies, and Ann knew that. Because of this, while the court determines that Ann was a bully, Ann was determined to be a bully only against Mercy members but not the general public. The general public has no rights to retribute against Ann in violent means because that would violate Mercy's autonomy to treat bully against them with mercy.
            </div>
            In the above example, if Bob was indepedent or did not subscribe to any merciful doctrine, then the court would judge that Ann willfuly disregard the autonomy of others, and hence her corresponding autonomy is void by her willful disregard.

          <hide><hr>
            <div class=""></div>
            Within Reciprocative Justice, a person might treat a bully better than the bully treat others, but may not prohibit others from treating the bully "the way the bully treat others. When a society commits to treat bullies better than the bully treat others, that commitment is a preference of that society, and has no arbitrative power for the rest of the world. Pushing that preference onto the rest of the world becomes an act of authoritarianism.

          <div class="">Q: What happens if a company's product harms its customers?</div>
          <hide><hr>
            <div class=""></div>
            If the potential harms are declared, the trade is considered mutual and the company is not guilty of violating autonomy. If the potential harms are hidden from the customers (i.e. the customers are deceived), then the company has violated autonomy and there are two effects: 1) The company voids its corresponding autonomy that it violated the customer. 2) The company is liable to reimburse the customers of their losses and damages. The two effects are simultaneous, not either or.
            <div class="">
              <h4>Example 4.1</h4>
              Eve lied to Fey about the ingredient and sold Fey a cake with a price of $100.  Fey got sick, incuring medical expense of $10000. Eve is simultaneously liable for two things: 1) Violation of Fey's autonomy. Which is estimated as Eve's wealth times Fey's expenses (including $100 + $10000) divided by Fey's wealth. 2) Reimbursement of Fey's expenses (including $100 + $10000).
            </div>
            In the equation, Fey's expenses appear twice, which led to an intuitive but not entirely correct folk law that the offender is liable for twice the damage. But the equation with Damage Equity considered is this:
            <div class="">
              <h4>Equation 4.2</h4>
              <center>OffenderLiability = VictimExpense √ó ( 1 + OffenderWealth / VictimWealth )</center>
            </div>
            The more wealthy the offender is compared to the victim, the more the offender would be liable to pay the victim. The amount beyond 100% comes from the offender's violation of autonomy. That amount is not "punitive damage" even if it has a deterent effect. That amount just represent the principle that when you violate someone's autonomy, you are giving people a free ticket to violate your autonomy. The reimbursement brings the victim back to a state as if nothing happened, the extra is the malicious benefit the offender forced the victim to volunteer reciprocated, where the offender becomes a voluntary giver of the benefit.

              <h4>Scenario</h4>
              <hr>
              :
              "Ann gives Bob food with an ingredient he's allergic to &amp; dies, but has no family or friends, how does Bob receive justice? Does Ann get the death sentence? How would mercy be determined? Proving whether it was intentional or unintentional is difficult." 
            </div>
            <div class=""></div>
            The short answer is if it was judged as an accident, Ann is liable if she continues to give gift food without warning the receiver about this incident, that her gift killed someone before. 
            <hr>
            <div class=""></div>
            <b>Long Asnwer:</b><br>
            The first question to answer is if the victim Bob still has his rights intact (not void). If Bob's right to life was already void, Ann would not be liable for taking his life. The second question to answer is if the victim Bob has a priori subscribed to the principle of mercy that would have waived reciprocation toward an offender. Such subscription would limit the maximum sentence Ann would be liable for if found guilty. The following assumes that Bob's rights are intact and had not wavied reciprocation. <br><br>
            <div></div>
            <h4>Judging Malice</h4>
            To judge malice, the court could consider these factors. In the example, the most important factors would be the existence of a motive and a priori knowledge of Bob's fatal vulnerability to food allergies.

            The difference in the outcome is known while Ann's malice is judged. If Ann is judged to incompetence, Ann would be liable to the damage and to provide warning to others of her incompetence. If Ann is judged to be malicious, Ann would be liable to both the damage and her corresponding right would be void.

            </div>
            In reciprocative justice, only the victim may waive violation to their autonomy by asserting using their autonomy to pardon on a case-by-case basis. If the victim(s) are dead, it is up to each person to decide whether they choose to reciprocate. An offender who wishes for mercy would pray that the victim does not die, which defeats the purpose of the offense. Reciprocative Justice thus drives self-restrain. In this example, if Ann is judged to be intentional, Ann may bargain with each individual executioner for her life. Ann may also join a group that would help bargain for her.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> We could still do TVP, because it says for the world to be peaceful, the world's resources must be globally managed.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think I am against using others as an example.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I think that using real examples help people recognize that the fallacies are happening around them.</hide>

  <div></div><b>3B:</b> Okay, so on page 3, I can have a pudding say, "If you divide the world and give each person a share, then the world will turn into a prison! Therefore, no one shall have a share of the world for the world to be shared!"

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> To transit to the next page, I want to leave some guidance for the reader on how to tell whether a statement is slippery slope. Any suggestion?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I think the key point of it being a slippery slope is that it asserts what will happen without deducing. If it shows the deduction then it is not slippery slope.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> If it fails to account or eliminate other possibilities, then it is slippery slope.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think it is easier to show the second way. You can show a statement is slippery slope if you show another probable and meaningfully different result that the speaker ignores.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="" probable. If the alternative proposed is less likely, then overall it is still moot to point out the alternative.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Then which consequence is more likely? Will more people not share if they have a share? If you don't force people to share, will they share their share?</hide>

  <div class=""><b>Looking</b> at Chapter 16 Page 2, I feel that I am at a huge disadvantage XD
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I already have my weapon drawn because Red was supposed to pull a monster.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Not a cute pudding that we might end up befriending. XD</hide>
  </div><hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I'm sorry. üòñ</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> Do you want to do something else?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I talk to Evelyn and here is a summary.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Originally, the Logfall Dungeon is supposed to have monsters that represent fallacies. We the training party is supposed to spot them and swiftly defeat them.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> The skills and weapons we use to defeat them are supposed to be mnemonics of the corresponding action needed to defeat them in real life.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Next is the complication that I'll let Evelyn speak for herself.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Evelyn:</b> According to reciprocative justice, we are not supposed to use lethal forces against monsters unless they make lethal offenses.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> So for Zoey to fire an arrow at them, we would have to imagine something horrible that the monster is trying to do or have done.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't want that. üôè</hide>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Since peacemaking is mostly not about such life and death situation, maybe we should tone down the conflict in the training.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe we don't need to represent empathetic communication skills as lethal combat skills.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Imagine the "monster" is just someone passing a flyer with their beliefs. We wouldn't respond by drawing weapons at them.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> There is a whole category of interaction that is missing in the quest.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> So I thought, maybe the objective of the LogFall Quest should be we go as a party of peacemakers, we listen to what people say and look for conflicts that already exist, then we try to make the situation more peaceful.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> It would be a quest where we spot common grounds and finds ways to reconcile and move forward.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> Chapter 16 does not yet have an updated charter.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I propose updating the charter according to Evelyn's vision if the other players don't object. Her overall vision of understanding and reconciliation are within resolution methods for logical fallacies.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I am somewhat okay with this plan, but if you remove the action component, the manga would just be people talking to each other on every page. It would be boring. XD
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't know what to say to that. üòñ</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ledia:</b> I think... why don't I be the trainer and attack the party? I say something, and if it takes you too long to decide whether I used a logical fallacy, then you lose hitpoint.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I'm okay with that XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think I am okay with that also, as long as we aren't the one starting the attack.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> So are you okay with me firing arrows at Ledia, but not at the pudding?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I am okay with you firing at Ledia because she is a volunteer. The pudding is innocent. üòÖ</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> Am I supposed to include this discussion in the manga...?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I seriously don't know. The context is changing too much from one page to another. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> The monster card might not be relevant, so Page 3 might need to be re-drafted.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I'm sorry. üòñ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think it is good that we are trying to be constructive.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think we should update the charter. I don't understand what we are doing.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree please help us.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> The template for the new Charter 16 is here!</hide>
  <lnk>202210282241 | Charter 16 @Dungeon</lnk>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Okay. I added something.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think we need a plan to avoid having 3B draw the wrong thing.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think it would be okay if the prompt is clear. If we allow the peacemaker trainees to TPK, then there is less planning necessary.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Why isn't Ledia on our side? XD</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> I am more motivated to draw something that is current, so that we could look at it as we consider what to do next.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> As opposed to me just drawing from a set script.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Then we need to pick a prompt.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Hold on. I think it is worth spending Page 3 on the transition where Evelyn calls Time Out and introduce our internal conflict and design of the manga.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Can you really fit that on one page? XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Maybe like this?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> 3B is a genius. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I did skip a lot of the conversation, but kept that there was a dispute about the quest and a change.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I'm okay with that. I'm okay with Ledia deciding the prompt for Page 4. Try and TPK us. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Hmm... I'll have to consider what dress to go with it.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> XD</hide>
  <mbkudo><b>Evelyn thanks all for being open to the last minute changes.</b></mbkudo>

  <div class=""><b>The</b> original purpose of the dungeon is for you to stop yourself from using logical fallacies, so that you could protect yourself from drawing wrong conclusions.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> If you aim to scout then resolve conflicts, you would need additional skills such as identifying the core value of a message, even when it is encased in layers of fallacies in the attempt to spread the messaage.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> So let's start with an exercise of identifying the core, of dragons.</hide>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> @3B, since we are at Wyvern Island, I think it would be fitting for Ledia to cosplay as a dragon tamer.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> The context would be on Wyvern Island, there are dragons routinely fighting each other, and peacemakers make peace among them so they can be friends.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> I understand, but for the flow of the manga, I'll need either an overall of the quest, a skill tree, or a dragon we are looking at.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's first chart the skill tree at the charter node.
  <lnk>202210282241|Charter 16</lnk>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I categorized them into three groups: Scouting, Prioritizing, and Resolving.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> We start with Scouting, where we identify the core value of a message. Identifying that will also help us in resolving.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Since that skill tree is small, I think there is enough space to start the prompt on the same page.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Does the plot have to move so fast? Can't I have a whole page where I just show up?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Could you show up with a dragon carrying a message?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Fair enough.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="" 
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> Is that all that can fit on a page? Should we discuss it further now or wait?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Please wait...</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I hope that I don't forget my line. XD</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> Sorry for the wait. There is no room left in page 4 for responses. Please read the draft for now and think about the prompt Ledia left us.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think this is a good draft. The prompt is clear for me to form an answer.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I kind of look forward to the next page. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Please wait for me to draw Page 4 first. When I am too far behind from the discussion, it makes me feel stressed.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think that for the story, it will flow well if we continue with what we disagree. Then we can naturally discuss how to disagree without hurting people.</hide>

  <div></div><div class="" However, if I draw it out, it would really be just people talking.
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> Instead of drawing the party talking to each other, I want to draw what you imagine when you speak your line.
  <div></div><div class="" can be represented by an element.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> For example, Evelyn said that she thought that the speaker was expressing their desire. I associate desire as Fire. So Evelyn thought the message has a fire core.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I thought we were talking about what we agree with, not what the message is about.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> When you agree that education is helpful, I associate education with Earth element.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I can kind of see that, and I hope that we return to having more RPG style content, instead of just us talking.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Please build up the presentation so that we can fight some monsters. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> No promises.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> For changes would that be a water dragon?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I see change as wind because water can be static but wind can't.</hide>
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> When we are talking about what we agree on, are we talking about what element we have, or what the message has?... They are the same if they are shared, isn't it?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Right.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> I think the elemental types need to be introduced. How important are the elements? Will they be used again?
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think they are important if we want to map the discussion back to RPG. If we can describe concepts by elemental types, they we can represent solutions as elemental gear.
  <mbaa>LRRH receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Okay. Then I will split page 5 into two pages.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> For my visualization, may I change the element to water? I was imagining nourishment like watering the flowers.
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> So I picture a scene where Evelyn is watering flower. Is that good enough? Should it be more RPG-ish?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe instead of me watering, it could be a water spirit watering?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Do you want to be able to summon water spirit?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think I am fine just seeing water spirits.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Okay.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> For Earth element I imagine James working out. XD
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> If you don't want to design a water spirit you could draw Natalie also.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I'll consider it.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Then for Wind core could you draw Kisa packing lunch.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I don't get the association.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Kisa has air element magic.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think the reader won't understand, and I want to show that in one frame preferably.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> How do you show adaptablity in one frame?</hide>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> How about Kisa making sushi roll? It is rolled first and then cut, not the other way around.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> If there is space I could draw P4 doing it the other way around.</hide>

      When I was 5 years old my mother told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up I wrote down 'happy'.They told me I didn't understand the assignment. And I told them they didn't understand life.

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> The messages are written by someone, if we know that they have a good intention, then why would we fight them?</hide>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Couldn't you just imagine that they possessed and try to do too much, and their desire is burning them and people around them?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> We are fighting their resentment, impatience, ignorance, etc. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> And not everyone write messages with good intentions. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think I am okay with fighting forces that possess people.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> So can anyone identify something they disagree with?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> 1) Your venture is not doomed even if you focus on one thing. Because you are not the only peacemaker. Just do the right thing that you are good at.

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I got a legit award. XD</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I agree with the first point but I think the second point deals too much damage. üòÖ
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> It is like you are trying to use barrage when the person you want to help is in the same area.
  <button class=""</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think that is much better. üòä</hide>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Any other disagreement?

  <mbaa>LRRH receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> It is a quote isn't it?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Ronald Reagan.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> And what do you want to say with that quote?</hide>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Culture can change quickly, and the law can help change the culture.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Good laws teaches people what is good and guides them when their judgement is biased by self-interest.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Being able to distinguish good laws from bad laws, and being able to derive good laws opens a fast track to cultural change.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Evelyn, any disagreement?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think I want to focus on making sure that our messages don't hurt people harm because this training was originally aimed at defeating our own biases.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> But I changed from the plan. So I need to be responsible.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> @3B how are we doing on paging?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think we need an item that represents the ability to tell good and bad laws apart.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think that would be a quest by itself. Each principle that can tell the difference can be an item.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Okay.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think we can go harder on ourself because we know each other's intention. But we should be more lenient toward others
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I don't get this logic. You are saying if you know that someone has good intention (us), then you can go hard on them. Then wouldn't you go just as hard on others if you assume that they also have good intentions?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> ...</hide>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> You can't assume people who have good intention can take criticism.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> When you attack a demon possessing a person, the person could try to protect the demon. You need to debuff.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Isn't that what we just did? We showed that we are not bad people by telling them something we agree with.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> How do you know if you have done enough debuff?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> On one end, if they ask for help then there is enough debuff.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> But they start at the other end when they are trying to promote their message.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think you can tell from a change in tone. For example when they change from asserting a perspective, to accepting the concept being situational, to expressing openness and curious of other solutions and perspectives.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think there is enough content for at least one page. But I want Ledia to finish this concept on what to do at each stage.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> When they are asserting their perspective, a debuff is to declare a common perspective. That's what we did. When your common perspective show situational difference, the speaker might double down on the absolute rhetorics or tone down and agree that it is situational.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Then, unless they ask for more, you wait for at least one night for their mana to recharge. People who are low in mana are vulnerable. If you keep persuing you are just asking them to be repossessed.</hide>
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> The goal is not to beat the demons for them. But to bring them to a state where they can beat their own demons.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> When they have a desire to beat their own demons, then they will start asking the right questions.</hide>

    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> I reduced the disagreements into two main points, one from Zoey and one from Red. I want supporting examples for each visualization.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> You didn't include the point where I got Arcacia Award. XD</hide>
    <button class="" doesn't address that someone is tackling the root problems for the overall team to succeed.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Okay. XD</hide>
    <div></div><b>3B:</b> For Zoey's point, I think the page needs an example of harnessing people's self-interest for good.
    <div></div><b>3B:</b> For Red's point, I need one example each for how laws and technology shifts the culture for good.
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think the Internet and social media changes a culture much faster than education.
    <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> On laws would be environmental and land use laws.
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think people would want to know specifically how the internet makes the culture better, such as letting people learn what they need for free. The internet did not create a situation where people have to pay for everything they want to learn.
    <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Because it only takes one person to share the information freely for its price to go down to zero. As long as the law protects free teachers, the culture of free teaching can thrive.
    <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> In that context, the thing that needs to be tackled are authoritarian laws that try to monopolize and turn something that could be free into something that requires a fee.
    <div></div><b>3B:</b> I imagine showing a cooking show on a screen. But that moves the plot away from RPG doesn't it?
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I suppose the computer that displays the show doesn't need to look like a computer, but something magical.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Good point. I still need an example for Zoey.</hide>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think if you change the order and have Red goes first it would flow better.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I am imagine an adventurer party where each adventure have a different reason.</hide>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think what might help is contrasting before and after to show how the example makes things better.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> For example, in sharing of cooking recipe, it wasn't because people didn't want to share, but that it was time consuming or costy to share.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> The internet makes it more worthwhile to share.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I will consider that because it might take too much space.</hide>
    <div></div><b>3B:</b> I think I have a better picture of what to draw now. Please wait for the graphical draft.

  <div class=""><b>This</b> is not an emergency. Red pulled for the text version of @Dungeon.
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I thought we are following 3B's pace and not making any move. XD
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Manga pace is too slow.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think Red lacks patience. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I would see that as a fire core.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think we should follow a general flow: Conflict identification, Preparation, Deployment.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Red has been pulling while skipping the first two phases.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> @StarTree, please add preparation in charter 16 Skill Tree</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Done!</hide>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think it would be helpful if we list and compare our general flow specific to Magic Bakery.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> The skill tree is beneficial for others but we need a flow that targets specifically what we should do since Red would just pull things.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Specifically, we are wasting a lot of power when Red posts on Twitter without a link from the blog.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Ideally, everything that Red posts at Twitter should be a leaf node.</hide>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Twitter might be going down.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Then we should copy the content to the blog.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="" is an attack to neutral.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Should that go to honorism or autonomy node?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think Honorism. But more importantly, it should simply be somewhere, we could rearrange them later.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It could go to a cache node, or your Cute is Justice node.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> ... The message wasn't really cute.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Then you don't get the EXP for leveling up Cute is Justice.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> For now please add to Honorism node first.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Added!</hide>
  <lnk>202207202118|Honorism</lnk>
  <center></center>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I like the idea of showing grammarly tone rating.
  <div></div><div class="" for @Dungeon, I would nominate @Dungeon for S rank.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree please make a section at @Dungeon Charter and I will fill it up with a draft.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Wouldn't that be the same as the Skill Tree section?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think they are different because I want to talk about specifically what to do for the blog.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think you can do that using bubbles.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> When a skill gets enough content, it should be its own node. The content of Charter 16 can be specific to the blog.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I mean the default content of Charter 16 can be about how the game is run at Magic Bakery.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I understand, and we can rearrange and merge the content as needed later. For now please make a section for the flow draft.</hide>
  <button class="" section is now added!</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I added the flow section. I think we should fill it with what Red pulled so we can triage.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I like this organization.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I am adding things to the lists.</hide>
  <mbcomplete>Little Red Riding Hood added 13 items to the lists.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Zoey:</b> This is equivalent to saying Red pulled 13 monsters with no backup. XD
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Pulling means you actually responded instead of just noting to the guild that they exist. XD</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> I think this type of operational content, these lists, should not be in the Charter but in the quest node.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I see. @StarTree please move that section to Logfall Quest node.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Done!</hide>
  <lnk>202207161025|Log Fall dungeon</lnk>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> I think each step can be its own expanded section. Especially the asset list.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> The Monsters section of that node is still using the old links.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, please upgrade all the Monsters links to new style.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Done~~!</hide>
  <button class=""</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I propose that we should focus on clearing the content in the Staging Area. When the staging area is clear, we pull from the Sightings board
  <button class="" at the Staging Area.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> As I understand, that is for creating a node that defines the difference between a religion and a philosophy.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> The point I wanted to make is that a religion is something a person treats as truth despite counter evidence. It is related to identifying indoctrination.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's create the node and clear it.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Node is added!</hide>
  <lnk>202211131155|Religionism</lnk>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I added notes.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Fina:</b> Can we make a judgement that religionism is unstable as a concept?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Fina:</b> I would define religionism to be the belief that adhering to, and not questioning, a set of belief is good.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think yes. In the same node.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's try deploying a response. To deploy a response, we should declare the purpose of the response (who it promotes peacemaking), craft the response, and deliver the response.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think it is worth responding because this is a case with a conflict where sharing definition can improve communication.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> And the OP asked for a responses.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think if you would respond with a link to the node, the content of the node needs to include an explanation of the grading rubric.
  <button class=""</hide>
  <div></div><div class="", without making a prediction that it will explode.
  <div></div><div class=""
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Yes.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think I understand now, but I think we need a node just to explain the rating so that we can link to it whenever something rated negatively.</hide>
  <button class="" as a solution type.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> In that rating definition, wouldn't Trust also be extinction grade?</hide>
  <button class="" node first.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Done!</hide>
  <lnk>202211131325|Hazard Rating</lnk>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> So I composed a response. How do you want to review it?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think you can just post it on this thread.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Shouldn't the content be on the Hazard Rating node?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Yes that would be better.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think the example of an dishonorable response for that node is out of place.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think if you want to talk about honorism, you would need to first get an audience that has opt-ed in.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Updated.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think what we have now is good enough.</hide>
  <button class=""</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think it is not an attack when it is definitional without using derogatory terms.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That standard should be added to the Deployment section.</hide>

              Answering this question requires defining atheism. My definition is: Atheism is a lack of belief in any god. With this definition, atheism is a form of religion for people who close themselves to counterevidence, but not for people who are open to counterevidence but have not seen such evidence to believe there is a god.<br>

        <div class=""></div>
        A general method of reducing the hazardous concept is to get ride of the hazardous part by being more specific about the concept.

        <div class="">
          <h4>Statement A</h4>
          "Science and math shall decide how people live."
        </div>
        The statement above is Conflict Inducing because it violates autonomy. A statement that does not violate autonomy would be this:
        <div class="">
          <h4>Statement B</h4>
          "Science and math can be used to calculate the extent of viotion among people."
        </div>
        Statement B and Statement A do not share the same meaning. Statement is Conflict Resolving. The part in Statament A that leads to conflict is intentionally removed.

        The following responses do not address the hazard:
        <div class="flex">

          If a nation initially refused to join the world community we feel that in time, given the opportunity to look at our system and compare it with their own, they would come around. There would be no pressure, no arm twisting, no torture and no military force. We do not envision forcing our values upon people.<br><br>
          If people do not identify with The Venus Project, they will not join us. They will have their independence and can choose another kind of lifestyle.  We believe that eventually most people will join with The Venus Project and unify the world toward a common goal, but it cannot be forced.

          <h4>2022-11-15</h4>
          <hr>
          <div class=""></div>
          In Stewardism/Hospitalianism/Quest Society/Gaia Society, there are rules that allow people to opt-out of a society. Does RBE have rules about that? I have asked this question of people who claim to understand RBE but their replies were either no or they could not give an answer. So here is the question: 
          <div class="">
          "If the world is already being managed according to your philosophy, can a person born within your managed world opt-out? If so, what do they get for their independence?"</div>
          <div class="flex">
            <div class="">
              <center><b>Gaia Society</b></center>
              <hr>
              Your ownership of your share is on-going. Your resource manager is an agent of your choice if you choose to appoint one. You may also manage your share by yourself for your independence.<br>
            </div>
            <div class="">
              <center><b>Resource-Based Economy</b></center>
              <hr>
              "This is just a hypothetical question. <hl>No one will want to opt-out of RBE.</hl>"<br>
              "Stop asking the same question. We have answered it many times. You clearly don't understand what RBE is. You need to read more."<br>
              
            </div>
            <div class="">
              <center><b>Techno Authoritarianism</b></center>
              <hr>
              If you want independence, then don't join. <hl>Once you join, there is no way to opt-out</hl> of the resource/land we got from you because we believe that the option to opt-out will lead to wars.
            </div>
          </div>
          


          Note that none of the three responses contradict the literal meaning of FAQ 125. If the FAQ was written for Gaia Society, the FAQ can simply be amended to highlight people may opt-out. However, since Gaia Society was designed to uphold freedom of association, it has a more clear answer:

          <div class="">
            <div class="">[125] What about people who don't want to participate in a Gaia Society?</div>
            <hide><hr>
              Gaia Society is not a type of society where you need to "opt-in" because it is comprised of resource management agents of your choice to manage your share of the world. <br><br>
              You may manage your share by yourself, you may use any management applications, and you may join any management community. A management community that does not let you opt-out and return control of your share to you is considered a violator of your rights.

          <hr>
          <div class=""></div>
          Since the FAQ response could equally apply to Techno Authoritarianism where a person's rights would be violated (in particular, freedom of association, autonomy), TVP FAQ 125 is at risk of being seen as an indoctrinative response, or RBE itself is at risk of being a philosophy of indoctrination. 
          <div class="">
            <h4>Suggested Revision</h4>
            Revise TVP FAQ 125 to clarify that people who have already joined may opt-out and be given their fair share of resources and automation for their independence.

      <b>LRRH:</b> Origiinally, it was part of the game where our GM Vivi would select which city with low Place Level to attack, and the guild would defend that city by upgrading its blog content. 
      <button class=""></div></button>
      <hide class=""> 
        <h4>2021-12-24 ish:</h4>
        <hr>
        Place Level is used by the game to determine whether an invasion at a place would succeed. If the place's level is higher than or equal to that of the invasion force at the end of the day, the invasion fails. When used correctly, this game mechanism is used by the GM to target a place for upgrade (i.e. The Villain Player declares they would attack a certain town, then the Hero Players can roleplay defending the town by upgrading its level. If they succeed, the town is defended.)
      </hide>
      But that mechanism was deemed too stressful because people might spend time updating the content when there are more important things to do in real life. Therefore now Place Level serves as a guide for sharing and recognizing ideas that would make a section informative and pretty.

Start at unranked, a chapter ranks up depending on the difficulty and number of quests completed. The ranking of a chapter is the highest rank of quest completed followed by the number of quests completed.<br>

          <div class=""><b>Arcacian Call</b> is a full spectrum skill for all six peacemaker archetypes. It boosts alertness, creativity and goodwill while dispeling negative feelings and empowers you to do something helpful to yourself and others. It is the general channelling of mana for your better self to cast its magic! 
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Arcacian Award refers to the feeling and the 3 points we get for scoring. The name of the skill itself at Magic Bakery is Arcacian Call. You may call it anything that resonantes with your better self.</hide>
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> It is not necessarily to have a name for it as the channel can be open at-will instantly. There is no spell to memorize or spell casting ritual. It is about being in a state of mind of opening up to the better self.</hide>

              <div class=""></div>
              The feeling often comes with a eureka moment and points to path of the solution. It is like both your conscious self and your subconsious self are tackling the problem at the same time. 
              <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> The response from your subconscious comes with that feeling.</hide>

              When I don't know what to say, I search myself until I get a response that has a strong resoance, which would be the most loving and healing course of action.

              <div class=""></div>
              Arcacian Call is the skill of opening the channel to assign a task for Arcacia. It is also the feeling when Arcacia calls back and wants you to do something. 
              <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Arcacian Call is free. You can stay on the line as long as you want.</hide>

              It is a source of creativity that gives you wacky ideas that you can't wait to try and share.

              It should be stressed that the response that comes with that feeling is not necessarily "the truth". 
              <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> But it is a response that draws deep into ones commitments, which a person might temproarily forget, and accounts for information and feelings that could be in the blindspot of a person's conscious mind. By opening the channel, you are using the full capacity of what your mind is capable of.</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> There are 8 open quests, 427 quest hours, 133 side quests, and 14 prep quests!
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree cleared 5 prep quests related to recognitions!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Let's try getting the number down to 7.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Evelyn:</b> I'll do the potion quest.
  <mbrec>Evelyn is recognized as Herbalist.</mbrec>
  <mbcomplete>Potion Quest is complete.</mbcomplete>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> StarTree please roll for the remaining 8 prep quests.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Sonic attack defense upgrade!</hide>

  <mbrec>V is recognized for resistance to sonic attack.</mbrec>
  <mbcomplete>Five preparation quests remain.</mbcomplete>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree cleared some that were already done!</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> StarTree, we missed the soft deadline of advancing every charter rank to B by the end of 21st. Can we rank up Cardinal to B now and continue without waiting for the next day?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree has no idea!</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> No. That's bad for auditing.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> It won't be an issue with auditing because we have a written request for the rank up in this thread.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> If you do that it will promote people going from Rank U to Rank A on the same day, that means each charter quest is only updated once per month.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> Normally in one sitting a person would update a few things for one rank up. If you let them rank up multiple times in one sitting, they would end up doing the same amount and ask for a rank up for each thing they complete.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> I think they would end up doing more because once they are stuck at rank A, they would want to get to Rank S. And that needs to be nominated.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I am proposing that a charter quest can rank up more than once on the same day, if there is a written log to show the amount completed would have worth one day, but the quester wants to continue.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think we have already seen what happens with the current system. It is quite good but it is weird that if you put in more effort on the same day you can't rank up more than once. I think we should try and see what happens with Tanya's proposal.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> And I like that a thread like this is required for multiple rank up because it gives more variety to the chat. Some charters almost never have any chat content.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think that is a compelling reason. I am for more chat on sharing what we are doing.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> StarTree, how many quests are still in Rank C right now?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Not including those updated today, three! @Treasure, @Mira, and @Wish!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> It will be a mess for auditing because on the calendar, when there is a checkmark on the quest, it means that it should have a higher rank the next day.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> If StarTree changes the rank of @Cardinal from C to B right now and you don't finish completing rank A, StarTree could make the mistake of incrementing it to rank A because it still has the checkmark at the end of the day.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> And when I look at the calendar, I would need to click on the threads and look for whethere there is a comment and approval on multi rank up.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> So I propose keeping the same system unless you also propose a way so that StarTree won't make mistake and it would be easy for me to audit. In the meantime, if you do the three remaining quests, it would probably be the end of the day already so no change is needed when you continue @Cardinal.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I see.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I still like the idea that we could rank up more than once.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> Your proposal needs to take care of how StarTree scores it and how I audit it.</hide>
  <mbaa>Vivi receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Fair enough.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I don't really know how StarTree does the scoring and Vivi aduits it. Would you propose how it might work?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> I don't want to consider it until all the Rank C charters are cleared.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Actually I also prefer helping charters that are lagging behind first. üòÖ</hide>
  <mbrec>Vivi is recognized as Auditor.</mbrec>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree will try to make the scoring work and avoid mistakes regardless how you want!</hide>
  <mbcomplete>Ledia completed @Mira by upgrading the profile for Fina.</mbcomplete>
  <mbcomplete>Casey completed @Treasure by updating notes on maintenance.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> @LRRH, is there something we can help for @Wish?
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Yes, I heard that someone wishes to change the monthly charter ranks tracking, so let's discuss how to make it better.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> üòä</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> @StarTree could you give a brief description of how the ranking is managed now?</hide>
  <div></div><div class="" at the spreadsheet.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> When the score is tallied at the end of each day, if a chapter has activity, then it will have one checkmark ‚úÖ next to the chapter name.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> After posting that result, the spreadsheet is updated with the new ranking of each chapter.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Therefore, when the result is posted, if a chapter has a checkmark next to it, then you shall see that its ranking increases on the next day.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> An exception is when a chapter is nominated for Rank S, then its rank immediately changes to Rank S!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Why is there an exception for Rank S?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Because oftentimes a chapter is nominated on the last day of the month, if it is not changed immediately it will not be displayed since the scores reset on the 1st of each month!</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ledia:</b> Why don't we show the current rank at the end of each day? So that when a chapter is displayed in Rank B with a checkmark, it means that the chapter advanced to Rank B today, not that it will become Rank B tomorrow.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree has no problem doing that if that is what the guild wants!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Anyone has any objection? @Vivi?</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> If a chapter ranks up more than once, could you use a different icon or use a checkmark per rank up?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree posted what it would look like if @Cardinal has two checkmarks!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Vivi:</b> I looks a little ridiculous. Although it is understandable.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> If @Cardinal ranks up twice, it would be in Rank A. The others should be in Rank B.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree reposted to make it more representative!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think it looks fine when they are spread out.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> StarTree could you post all of the chapter so we can see what it looks like?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> It is done, but this is a mock up! In practice, can StarTree still only update the result only once per day?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> What is the problem if you udpate it more than once?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Then at the end of the day StarTree can't tell if it has already been updated!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I'm fine with it only updating once at the end. I think the double checkmark looks fine.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Let's try this for some time first.</hide>
  <mbcomplete>Red updated @Guild and @Wish on multiple rank up on the same day. All chapters are at least Rank B for this month.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Should we try double rank up for one of those quests? I propose double rank up for @Cardinal because it is the most cumbersome quest to rank up in general.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> It is more efficient to do many rank up at once than to spread them to different dates.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I'll stay for @Cardinal if there is something I can do.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I'll stay too. üòä</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> StarTree roll for a prep quest please.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> This is triaged as a story quest about Valdanya tanking at Oct 10.
  <mbrec>Vladanya is retroactively recognized as a Commander and Tank.</mbrec>
  <mbcomplete>Quest site Evergale Valley is added.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> @Cardinal now has 8 open quests, 427 quest hours, 133 side quests, and 4 prep quests remaining!

              Freedom of Speech can be concisely defined by ranking it among other freedoms that a society declares to protect.

    <div class=""><b>Freedom of Speech</b> is a popular but ambiguous term as it is often used to defend a position with conflicting or no definition. This node compares three common definitions and related terms.</div>
    <div class="">
      <div class="">‚≠ê</span></div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        In this definition, speech means the action of expressing opinion or disclosing information. Regardless of the content, the author shall not be subjected to censorship or physical restrain.
        <div class="flex">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Allowed Speech</h4>
            <hr>
            Discussion of all political views / 
            Hate speech / Verbal abuse / 
            False advertisement / 
            Lying under oath / 
            Forgery of documents /

          </div>
        </div>
        The party presented false information has the responsibility to judge whether the information is truthful or authentic. Contracts and promises are never binding and have no legal significance. The dispenser of false information is never liable to any damage. The believer of information can only blame themself.
      </hide>
    </div><!--Type 1 Absolute Free Speech-->
    <div class="">
      <div class="">‚≠ê‚≠ê</span></div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        In this definition, speech only refers to a set of content and context, not all manners of information disclosure. The legislature might be declare by listing what is allowed or what is disallowed. The following is an example.
        <div class="flex">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Allowed Speech</h4>
            <hr>
            Discussion of all political views            
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Disallowed Speech</h4>
            <hr>
            Hate speech / Verbal abuse / 
            False advertisement / Lying under oath / 
            Forgery of documents / 
            Counterfeiting / 
            Identity theft
          </div>
        </div>
        This type of definition, while functional, it prone to misinterpretation unless the sanction list is clear. A way to avoid misunderstanding is to refer to this type of policy as "Sanctioned Speech" or "Protected Speech". 
      </hide>
    </div><!--Type 2 Sanctioned Free Speech-->
    <div class="">
      <div class="">‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</span></div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        In this definition, speech is defined as the action of disclosing information in the same way as in Absolute Free Speech, but as a freedom it has a ranking compared to other freedoms and does not override those that have a higher rank.
        <div class="">
          <h4>Example Ranking</h4>
          <hr>
          üëë<br>
          [1] Freedom of Autonomy<br>
          [2] Freedom of Speech<br>
        </div>
        With a given ranking, the illegality of an action is determined if it violates a freedom, starting from the highest ranked freedom. Using the example ranking above gives the result below.
        <div class="flex">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Allowed Speech</h4>
            <hr>
            Discussion of all political views            
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Disallowed Speech</h4>
            <hr>
            Hate speech / Verbal abuse / 
            False advertisement / Lying under oath / 
            Forgery of documents / 
            Counterfeiting / 
            Identity theft
          </div>
        </div>
        In this example, all of the speech in the disallowed section violate Freedom of Autonomy. This means that even if "Freedom of Speech" is absent from the ranking, the result would be the same, showing that the underlying principle behind the example in Type 2 is "Freedom of Autonomy". As a result, a Ranked Freedom framework allows a more concise and consistent way of defining freedom for a society.

        To show a lack of intention to offend, the offender can change their expression to be non-offensive when the victim tells them their expression is offensive. In general the victim should propose the non-offensive expression so that exchanges and conversations may continue.

        A public zone is where a person could rightfully be and relevant to their daily lives. When the domain is a public forum on the internet, the public area is the range of default articles and pages that a user could visit if then did not intentionally search for private or offensive content.

        According to reciprocative justice, an offender of hate speech violates the autonomy of the victim's right to be present. Thus, the offender voids their own right to be present. The offender is liable for damage they cause and can be expelled from the zone.

        <b>Synergy</b> can happen regardless of whether the entities are independent, dependent, or interdependent, as in the following examples:
        <div class="">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Independence</h4>
            <hr>
            Both Ann and Bob know how to drive and where to go. But they decide to to carpool so that each of them only needs to drive half the time, and either could cover the other if one feels unwell.
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Dependence</h4>
            <hr>
            Cid is the drive and know where to go. Deb is Cid's friend who could do neither. Cid could have gone for the trip by himself, but having Deb's company makes the trip a lot more fun.
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Interdependence</h4>
            <hr>
            Only Eve can drive and only Fey knows where to go. With only one of them, the trip would be impossible. Together they can do something they can't do separately.
          </div>
          <div class="spacer"></div><div class="spacer"></div>  
        </div>
        <b>Interdependence</b> can be used to describe a relationship where entities rely on each other in such a way that every member in the group would fail if any one of them is missing. When Ann and Bob are already competent in completing the trip by themself, making them become dependent of each other would make them more vulnerable to failure. Therefore, interdependence but itself is normally not a type of solution, but a vulnerability to overcome.

      <div class="">Solution: Forced Interdependence
      <span style="float:right">‚≠ê</span></div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        Forced Interdependence describes a solution where people are intentionally not given enough skill or access to be indepedent, they are made to be dependent on each other so that it would be disadvantageous for each of them to harm another.
        <div class="">
          <h4>Example: Hostage Families</h4>
          <hr>
          To avoid rebellion, the central government requires the families of feudal lords to live at the capital as hostages. 
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Example: Separation of Power</h4>
          <hr>
          To avoid a quick path to monarchy, a government separates its power into legislative, judicial, and executive branches, so that no single person may serve all functions at once.
        </div>        
        In the above solutions, the individual could do more, but their power to do so are limited. They are forbidden to do more. In peace ranking this type of solution belong to Rank 5: Control. 
      </hide>
    </div><!--Solution: Forced Interdependence-->
    <div class="">
      <div class="">Solution: Empowerment with Power Limit
      <span style="float:right">‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</span></div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        Forced Interdepedence can create unnecessary overhead and bureaucracy, and slow to adapt to technological changes. Empowerment with Power Limit is a solution type that let people streamline processes as long as the overall outcome does not lead to too much power.
        <div class="">
          <h4>Example: Homestead</h4>
          <hr>
          A person is allowed to own land, manage its resources, and set rules on their land as long as the practice does not create negative externalities (e.g. pollution). No tax is collected from the owner, but the owner may not own too much land such that someone does not have enough land to own.
        </div>
        In the example above, each land owner may function as a monarch, the the limitation of power could result in every person being a monarch in their own right, and no one needs to work for anyone to sustain their own life. In peace ranking, this type of solution belongs to Rank 3: Coexistence.
      </hide>
    </div><!--Role of Interdependence in World Peace-->
    <div class="">
      <div class="">Solution: Mutual Aid
      <span style="float:right">‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</span></div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        Mutual Aid describes the context where the entities of comparable abilities form an alliance to help each other in times of greater needs.
        <div class="">
          <h4>Example: Fire Fighting</h4>
          <hr>
          Each fire fighting team/department is a complete fire fighting unit that could normally handle their local incidents. When a big fire occurs, teams from different cities join force to fight together. 
        </div>
        Separately, none of the local fire departments can handle the big fire that <i>may</i> occur in their city. But together they have the resource to handle such rare emergency. In peace ranking this type of solution belongs to Rank 2: Cooperation.
        <div></div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Contextual Note</h4>
          <hr>
          Note that in the fire fighting example, if technology advances allow each local fire department to handle all incidents so that mutual aid is no longer necessary, limiting the technology available to fire fighters so that they <i>need</i> to cooperate with other cities is not a solution. Synergy is the solution to deal with a lack of individual power. Interdependence exists when the departments employs mutual aid as the solution. Interdependene by itself is remains a vulnerability.

  <div class=""><b>This</b> is about drafting for Chapter 16 Page 8.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> The topic is delivery and Ledia was in the middle of speaking.</hide>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> The Water element represents calmness and goodwill. Having too much of that can compromise security measures.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> In the drawing that is represented as leaving the gate open and the dragon enters on page 7.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> A way to deal with that is to put the people lowering the security and the threat in the same group. If what they preach would work, then the threat should be resolved. If they realize that what they preach would not work, then the second barrier containing them is still intact.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ivy:</b> When a change is proposed that would compromise security, inform the proposer of the list of threats and have them go on trial to show the effect of the proposal on those threats. Therefore, the key asset in resolving such conflict is the list of threats.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> The monster directory.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I am lost. How is this related to the original message and what we disagree on?
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Previously we looked at the message and each of you came up with something you agree, and what you disagree. Instead of just saying what you disagree, this step sets the trial so that both the original solution and your solution can be judged.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> If people agree on the rubric, you don't necessarily need to tell people a solution. They could come up with a solution.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think the original message had an Earth problem because it is trying to show that some views need to be eliminated, and their proposal of education of gradual culture shift are the only ways.
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> The counter element is Air, where Red and Zoey were saying that there are more ways.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Then are we comparing the cause of improvements? Because the original message argued that the <i>Only way</i> is such and such, we only need to find some counter examples where some other causes lead to improvement.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> In that case, the asset you need are a way to tell whether something is an improvement, a way to attribute the cause of the improvement, and an actual example.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> So we still need the rubric.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> For the manga, instead of discussing how to deal with each element one by one, I think it would be better if we focus on the element related to the message and continue with just that one, first.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> I think we need to do all elements at once, at least in the background. Without comparing them, we would misindentify the situation.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> We should make a node. We are defining magical elements for @Dungeon. @StarTree please make a node.</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> With these definitions, how do we tell if a message has too much of an element or too little of another element?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> The list is missing the assets that I was talking about.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> We need to add them also.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Let's start by treating the two as separate first. And see if it is redundant if we fill all six boxes.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> So far it looks like they are extremes on the same spectrum.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Should we call the middle Mutualism?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That's seems like the way to go.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> What is a word or phrase that means appreciation but too individualistic?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Egocentrism?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> And too collectivistic?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Fanaticism?</hide>
  <mbcomplete>The Mutualism node is created.</mbcomplete>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> With this definition, can we conclude that the message on page 4 meant a system must teach people out of extreme individualism or fail?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Yes. And we disagree because a system such as Quest Society can handle people who have an extreme individualistic view.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> We disagree that individualism is the only possible root problem. We disagree that educations and gradual cultural shifts are the only way to a better system.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Then I would say the original message only looked at the gap between extreme individualism and mutualism, and only the education/cultural path.
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> In that case, Evelyn would say, "The original message seems to consider only when there is too much individualism. If we consider both sides... a system that has too much collectivism can improve by allowing more individualism. In an actual society there are probably areas troubled by different extremes."
  <button class="" I think we can focus on listing all the paths instead of focusing on that we disagree.</hide>

  <div></div><b>3B:</b> I will have to think about how to transition from what we have to this fight.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Transition is easy. You could just draw that I summoned two monsters while the heroes are talking.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I am fine with Sasha's interpretation.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I can prepare page 8 with two monster. One Air element dragon for Extreme Individualism, and one Earth element dragon for Extreme Collectivism. They will both be shadow/illusion type monsters to be defeated for training purpose.</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I think I want a scene where the Earth monster breaks out from under us.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think I can draw that... So Sasha will use monster cards and appear in the corner.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> We need to design the monsters.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Earth monster: Turtle shaped dragon that can mindcontrol surrounding lives, suck their soul and, split out a darkening mist. Those caught in the mist become hallucinated and rely on the Turtle for guidance.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Air monster: Mecha dragon that absorbs surrounding resources and shoots missles.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think if the Air monster represents individualism, then it shouldn't be big. A single person can't build or maintain a mecha dragon. It takes some kind of hierarchy or forced collaboration for that to exist. I think a more fitting monster type would be a group of pillaging dragons that would also fight each other.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think the big mecha dragon would be part of the Turtle's hallucination.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> If we do that... it would seem that the mecha dragons don't exist in real life. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> It would be like the turtle is really fighting another turtle. The mist is there to absorb the freedom. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I don't mind that interpretation.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> If I draw this fight, then it will probably not end up the same way as finding paths for Mutualism. Because we are adding new things as we discuss.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> That's fine. The Turtle erupts from the ground and sprays mist, Through the mist we see the mecha dragon shooting missles at us.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Then would the Turtle ask us for help?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Yes, and if an actual mecha dragon is down, it would ask for help also.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think that is a good training setting.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Okay. Then please wait.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I think yes. But I don't want to get into any copyright issue. So no posting actual dialogues or text from the game.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think we could play as ourselves. So, regardless what the card says, the person who gets the card decides what to tell the rest of the group, and that will be what the rest know. If the describer misses a clue, then the group will miss the clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Exciting change.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> How do you plan to deal with the part about bonus clues for matching the agents?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I say let just count Arcacia Awards during the game. Maybe for every 6 Arcacia Awards for the game we get a bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think that will make the game harder.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think it will be okay.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> May I add a rule that in each round we are limited to the number of players for each clue? So that if we don't have six players, we get fewer clues per round?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I'm fine with that challenge if the players will help recruit in case we don't have enough.</hide>

    <div class=""><b>Magic</b> Bakery plays NCIS the game!
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> This thread is for us to play NCIS the Game with a Magic Bakery Spin where you get to play as yourself as a special agent.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The object of the game is to guess the culprit to arrest at the end of four rounds of searching for clues.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> In each round the players can choose 6 out of 8 locations to get clues.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> To avoid a player dominating the flow, each player decides where to go. The first player who decides to go will get the actual clue from the game by the GM (which is currently me).</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Once you get the clue, you may roleplay the content the way you want. You may reinterpret what happens (instead of following word-for-word the dialogue from the game).</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> However, if you miss a clue that is important, no one else will know it! That is part of the game in Magic Bakery Style.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> And we will keep track of the number of Arcacia Awards during the game. For every six awards, the group gets a bonus clue.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think that's enough explaining. Let's play!</hide>
    <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Warning: The actual cards may have violent content, but you are allowed to reword or change the scene.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> In the story, is Magic Detectives the agency receiving the cases?</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It can be. It is up to whoever that does the first plot twist card.</hide>
    </div><hr class="">
    <div></div><div class=""
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Please use CHAT for Roleplay content and BUBBLE for other discussions.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Did Tanya already sugarcoat the setting?</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Not really. I think how the young man appears and say might be important.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> At this point there are 8 possible locations to explore for clues: 1) The Crimescene. 2) The Headquarters, 3) The young man. and five other suspects that from the story you won't know yet, but in the game you could choose them.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> So, who wants to go to the crime scene?</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I suppose I should go because I am trying to save the victim.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I am on scene also. If the card has a dialogue, you could include me.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think in general we can all talk because we have phones.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Ok.</hide>
    <mbmerit>Evelyn gets clue 287</mbmerit>
    <div></div><div class=""
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> As Evelyn moves the body to custody, Tanya noticed a <b>bloody awl</b> nearby that could be the murder weapon. Tanya sends that as evidence back to the lab.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> What is an awl?</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> It is a piercing tool, such as for leatherwork.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Do we get points for guessing the murderer? How did the son be covered in blood if he was not the murderer? Were there any sign of him trying to save the dad? XD</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> The clue I got didn't say anything about evidence of anyone trying to help the dad.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I want to interview the son. XD I think we need to detain him.</hide>
    <mbmerit>Zoey gets clue 186</mbmerit>
    <div></div><div class="" Zoey asked.
    <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> "There are several people threatening my dad," said the son. He went on and provided four suspects: 1) A general who almost attacked the dad yesterday; 2) A neighborhood black kid who has been stalking the dad for a week, 3) A person by the name Tuna who was still angry; 4) And a terrorist guy who sent a threatening disc.
    <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Zoey can't help but feel that this son is trying really hard to find someone else as a scapegoat.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The remaining locations to explore this round are: 1) Headquarters, 2) The other general, 3) The black kid, 4) Angry Tuna, 5) The terrorist guy, 6) and another suspect.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think it might help to first get fingerprints or something from the awl. But I don't want to play that part.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I will take headquarters.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> But you already did plot twist 1.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I see.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Then we actually need seven people per round.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree please help us.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Wee~~!</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> StarTree FTW! XD</hide>
    <mbmerit>StarTree gets clue 262</mbmerit>
    <div></div><div class="" said StarTree.
    <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> At the quest channel, StarTree tells the other detectives about the finding.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Does that mean the blood stain is not from the son?</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> It is not clear from the clue!</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I think that is implied, since family members should have very similar blood. The clue card used the lastname. It wasn't clear whether the glove belonged to the victim or his son. I guess it meant the victim.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I want to interview the last suspect that hasn't been disclosed.</hide>
    <mbmerit>Ledia gets clue 23</mbmerit>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Ledia thinks that so far the awl is the most important evidence linking the victim to his attacker. Just around the house, there was a new addition being built. Tools and wood planks were laying about. It looks like more than one person were building the addition.
    <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> "Who was in charge of the construction?" Ledia asked the son.
    <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> The son said, "It is some carpentry guy my dad hired." He then gave Ledia the contact info.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think that is progress. And I think that the clue refers to the victim by lastname, and his son by first name. So the victim was wearing the glove.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> We can interview two more suspects before next round.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I suppose I will interview the other general.</hide>
    <mbmerit>Sasha gets clue 164</mbmerit>
    <div></div><div class=""
    <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Sasha thinks to herself, "How angry would you need to be to kill someone over a promotion?" Sasha doesn't find that to be a strong motive, but plays along to see how much the son knows about his dad.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Last clue before Plot Twist. Remaining clues are 1) The black kid, 2) The Terrorist guy, 3) Angry Tuna.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Terrorist guy.</hide>
    <mbmerit>Red gets clue 249</mbmerit>
    <div></div><div class="" Red went back to the talk show that blamed the victim for being one of the top strategists in the war. Is the victim a good guy or a bad guy?
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> And that's all for round 1! The game continues... Please return for Plot Twist 2!</hide>

      <div class="">ü•® Magic Bakery House Rules</div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        The following rules are mainly for players who are into roleplaying (i.e. describing yourself as a detective investigating and talking to suspects). If you don't want to RP, you can still choose clue, make guesses and comment.
        <div class="">
          ‚≠ê Each player may only choose one clue per round. 
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> That includes the plot twist card. So it takes at least seven players to get six clues before advancing the plot.</hide>
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>20221212: Sasha:</b> Depending on who is playing, we might reveal all 8 clues for the first three rounds, which leaves the last round with only 2 free clues to make the game *harder*!</hide>
          <div></div>
          ‚≠ê The player who chooses the card tells the rest what happens.
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> We are playing as ourselves, not the characters in the NCIS series. The player may simplify or change the content of the clue entirely. It is part of the game even if a vital clue is omitted.</hide>
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>20221212: Sasha:</b> If you think someone else can roleplay the content better, you may give them your clue for them to roleplay instead. The main point is that the person who chooses the clue may choose not to share it.</hide>
          <div></div>
          ‚≠ê Every six Arcacia Awards give a Bonus clue 
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> We don't track whether an agent matches the location because we are playing as ourselves. But we track the number of Arcacia Awards during the play. For every six Arcacia Awards, the team gets one more clue. Bonus clues are not bound by the player limit.</hide>
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>20221212: Sasha:</b> The original game was designed to give no more than 3 bonus clues. We keep that limit.</hide>
          <div></div>
          ‚≠ê Each player chooses a suspect that they would arrest.
          <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The players don't need to debate to reach a consensus on just one suspect. We will simply see who gets the right suspect.</hide>

        <b>Detective Level</b> = min(floor( sqrt( [Detective XP] √ó [Hit Rate])),[Win]) 
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Explanation of Detective Level: You need two things to level up. 1) You need to give relevant ideas on what to think about the case. They are counted by the lightbulb symbols. 2) You need to be correct when you guess the suspect or answer questions at the end of each game. Your detective level is the square root of your lightbulb count nerfed by your miss rate, and bound by your number of wins.</hide>
        <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> This means that if you are level 5, you must have been correct at least 5 times AND have helped others at least 25 times.</hide>

It think the intended complexity only allows a few clues connecting to a few suspects. Although I would not be surprised if the concept of alibis is used to eliminated a suspect in a later episode.</hide>

        "Don't make the kitchen floor wet" is not a solution because when the floor is wet, telling people don't make it wet doesn't dry and it doesn't address people who make the floor wet. In comparison stating an enforceable  consequence changes a demand into a solution.

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Can we finish both twists tonight and get the right culprit?</hide>
  </div><hr class="">
  <mbmerit>Sasha gets Plot Twist 3</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> P4 sent back some blood data of the classmate to the lab, and that turned out to be a match for the other blood stain on the victim's glove.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> How did P4 get his blood sample? XD
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> Can the suspects have names like Mr. Tuna?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It is up to you when you roleplay.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> P4 wants to continue with the classmate.</hide>
  <mbmerit>P4 gets clue 204</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>P4:</b> P4 went to look for the classmate Mr. Dolphin when he was playing a video game. When P4 knocked on his door, he started running out the backdoor and tripped on another P4. So we brought him back to headquarters. Mr. Dolphin has an incomplete gang tattoo.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Does it seem that if we had chosen Mr. Dolphin in Round 1 and Round 2, then plot Twist 3 would be chronological? And also Mr. Tuna and Plot Twist 2.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Yes... now you mentioned it.</hide>
  <button class="" XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree will check with Ivy.</hide>
  <mbmerit>StarTree gets clue 273</mbmerit>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Clue 273 turns out not to be a lab result but something Evelyn can roleplay!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Then I'll take clue 273.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="" asked Evelyn. With his permission, Evelyn cast inspect on Mr. Dolphin's legs.
  <mbrec>Evelyn is recognized for Cleric Skill Inspect.</mbrec>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> We might be behind, better get those Arcacia Awards coming for bonus clues.</hide>
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> If we follow the gray hair, I should keep going.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> You already did the plot twist. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Dang it. I forgot.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I continue with Mr. Tuna.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Red gets clue 131</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <mbaa>Little Red Riding Hood receives</mbaa>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> With that, Mr. Tuna calmed down and the two ended up exchanging business cards so Little Red could arrange dates for Mr. Tuna. Mr. Tuna works at a used car lot. At the quest channel, Little Red said, "Anyone up for a date with Mr. Tuna?"
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Three more clues for this round, everyone.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Given there are eight locations, four rounds, and six clues each round, by the end of four rounds we will only get 24 out of 32 clues. If we spread it evenly, we won't get to the last clue on any suspect. Presumably the last clue is the most important?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I don't remeber if that was the case for Episode 1.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> It wasn't.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> You are not supposed to say that, so they can play Episode 1.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I see.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Well... then I search at the crime scene again.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Ledia gets clue 241</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class="" asked Ledia.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree, please analyze.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Wee~!
  <div></div><b>StarTree:</b> These tires were made exclusively for two models of cars, the Royal, and the Grand!
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> The car in the picture I saw in the video chat with the commander was a Royal.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Case closed? XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I use my clue for Sasha to follow up on the other general.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Here we go!</hide>
  <mbmerit>Tanya gets clue 98</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Sasha went to question the other general that lost the promotion. He seemed rather happy that the victim was dead. The general refuses to answer any question, and told Sasha to ask his commander instead.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I couldn't get anything from that guy, except he gave me the vibe that he was actually a good guy.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Why do you say that?
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> He hangs a liberty or death flag. So at least he has some sense of justice.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Unless that means "Liberty for me or death for you."
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> In any case, I feel that he won't give us anything unless we have a warrant.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Finally someone who knows the drill. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Last clue for round 3. Who's going to do it?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Come on, son, tell us how you got blood all over yourself.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Zoey gets clue 212</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Should I interview him next?
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> But I feel I am so close to getting something out of him. XD
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> Well I will be close by.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Plot Twist 4, go go go!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I'll give my Plot Twist 4 for Zoey to RP.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Sasha gets Plot Twist 4</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> After ranting at the quest channel, Zoey decided to run a background search of the son and found that two years ago, he went to jail for a few weeks for assaulting his dad.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> May I also get the last clue for the son? XD</hide>
  <mbmerit>Zoey gets clue 280</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> As Zoey puts her gloves, the son panics, "No gloves! I'm allergic to latex!"
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think this is as much as the game can do to tell us he is not the murderer. GG.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I'll finish the search at the crime scene.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Ledia gets clue 5</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> In the grass near the flower beds along the driver, Ledia found a millitary style knife with a 7 inch long blade. Ledia wondered if its user was also wearing gloves when using it.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Lab!</hide>
  <mbmerit>StarTree gets clue 79</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> I think we need a warrant to get a sample from the lost general.
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> I need hair samples of every suspect, not just those with gray hair. A gray hair can come from someone who does not only have gray hair. And the suspect could have dyed their hair since.
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> I got a hair sample from the son. XD
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I suppose I did something right. XD But to be clear, my getting the hair sample was pure RP. The clue didn't get a hair sample from the son. XD</hide>
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Good job.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Would hair dye smell like food?
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> Generally no, unless you homemake it to smell nice.
  <mbaa>Ivy receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Three clues left! Two more Arcacia Awards for a bonus clue!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't think someone with problem walking would be a intruder and murderer.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I don't want to return to Mr. Tuna other than introducing a date.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> There are two suspects that we haven't intervewed: The Carpenter and the Terrorist.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I will go to the carpenter.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Red gets clue 234</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> According to background check, the Carpenter is ex-military and joined a militia. He was a suspected bomber of a post office. Little Red arrived at his home. It seems like he is meeting with someone at the moment.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> It's a trap. XD The game wants you to waste clues there.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I pick the general.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Tanya gets clue 178</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Tanya reviewed the chat log when Sasha spoke to the general. In the log, Sasha asked if he complained because the promoted general was of a minority race. But the general dodged the question and never answered.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> As I said, I couldn't get any answer from him. He neither admited nor denied anything other than he is proud of himself.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Last clue! No pressure.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> After getting the last clue, could we make one round of guesses, then reveal the rest of the clues to see if anything else important would be revealed?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Sure.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> So far the most important evidences are the hair, the car, and the knife. The general is readily associated with all three. Tuna is associated with two if he dyed his hair, and three if there is a match of that car as one of the used cars he sells.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> P4 will go check the car lot.</hide>
  <mbmerit>P4 gets clue 150</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>P4:</b> P4 went to the used car lot of Mr. Tuna to look for a Royal, a Grand, or his hair sample. Mr. Tuna does have a nice smell. A smell that is like... Thanksgiving? And then...
  <div></div><b>P4:</b> One of P4 had a glimpse of a car that might be a match, but it was just leaving the parking lot.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Let's pray. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Arcacia, please help us get one more clue.</hide>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Ike, P4!</hide>
  <mbaa>LRRH receives</mbaa>
  <mbaa>P4 receives</mbaa>
  <mbmerit>P4 gets bonus clue 141</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>P4:</b> P4 sped to that car and triple confirmed that it is a Grand. She found that the car wasn't really leaving the parking lot, but was only being relocated in the same lot. The car is for sale.
  <div></div><b>P4:</b> And the fourth P4 got a hair sample of Mr. Tuna.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That wasn't as conclusive as I thought it would be.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> There is room left for debate.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Here is how we will do it. If you guess right you can get Detective credit. The amount of credits you get is diluted by the number of people who get it right.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> My guess is Mr. Tuna. Mainly because I don't think a general would bother killing a fellow general over a promotion. Mr. Tuna has much more hatred at the victim, even though he would not actually gain anything from killing him.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Compelling.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> By the way, I hope that at least one of us get the correct culprit, so please spread out.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I also choose Mr. Tuna. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Then I'll choose the general just in case.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Whoever picked the right answer will have priority RPing the solution.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I pick the Terrorist guy.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I pick the general because he would be familiar with the house, and since none of the clues said the victim fought back or struggled, to me that suggests the victim was usually comfortable being around the murderer.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I pick the son.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> We have learned the lesson. Individually, each of us might fail, but together, one of us will arrest the right culprit!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Arrest them all!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> P4 picks the general, because the smell from Mr. Tuna might be his wife's shampoo.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Is no one trying to get more bonus clues?</hide>
  <mbaa>Ivy receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> We already have three suspects with all clues revealed. Two of them we can't eliminate. If we discount the strength of motive, the clue about hair dye smell might be for eliminating Mr. Tuna, since hair dye doesn't normally smell nice.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Then I pick the wannabe ganster.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree picks the carpenter!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Now, if we want, we can reveal the rest of the clues. I suppose the person who picked that suspect has priority RPing the rest of them.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I'll start first.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Red gets clues 89, 14, 37</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class="" at Mr. Carpenter's house. Mr. Terrorist is really a university professor and he was there to discuss with Mr. Carpenter about some renovation for the university. Little Red finds nothing suspicious.
  <mbmerit>StarTree gets clues 63, 101</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree accompanied Red on her visit to Mr. Carpenter's house. Mr. Carpenter admitted that the awl is his, and there is nothing else of significance to report!
  <mbmerit>Ivy gets clues 220, 268.</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Ivy confirmed that the meaning of Mr. Dolphin's tattoo. He is missing his first kill to qualify for the gang. Yet, while Evelyn is examining him, Dolphin said he killed the victim.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Everyone just hold on as I give Evelyn the next clue.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> While examing Mr. Dolphin, Evelyn realized that his hands were also trembling. Mr. Dolphin has advanced multiple sclerosis. Despite what he says, she thinks that he is merely trying very hard to fulfill his dream of becoming a gang member.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Well well well... any final words or wager before the solution is revealed?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Going once.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Going twice.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Reveal!</hide>
  <mbmerit>Solution</mbmerit>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> And the murderer was Mr. Tuna!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Motive: He killed the victim as a revenge. He objected the victim's aggressive tactics during the war which got his fellow soldiers and best friend killed. He couldn't get justice by speaking against him, and his wife left him. His life was ruined despite him actually wanting to return to the military.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Car Tracks: He drove the Grand to stalk the victim to avoid using his own car.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Knife: He used the knife to enter the house through the window, and found the victim installing shelves. He intended to kill him with his knife, but decided to use the awl because it can't be traced back to him. He sneaked up to the victim, who hardly any chance to fight back. He dropped his own knife on his way out unintentionally.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Gray hair: That was his, and his hair dye did smell nice: boiled sage. It wasn't that he dyed his hair immediately after the killing, but that he had some gray hair that creeps up.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Congratulations, Detectives. We arrested the right person!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Zoey and I both have half a detective point.</hide>

    <div class=""><b>Open Court</b> is public venue (which can be virtual) that the public may borrow to conduct trials of justice. Its existence comes from a society that allows different governments to coexist in the same geographical region.</div>

      <div class="">üìí Comparison</div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        The word 'open' refers to the facility being available for the public to borrow, as opposed to a courthouse with fixed judges serving one specific government.

      <div class="">üìí Why do Open Courts exist?</div>
      <hide><hr>
        <div class=""></div>
        The following are some factors that cause open courts to be a meaningful solution.<br>
        <div class="">
          <div class="">
            <h4>Mixed Society</h4>
            <hr>
            <div class=""></div>
            Societies based on choice democracy in justice need a way to arbitrate conflicts that occur between parties that had chosen different justice model.  
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h4>Not enough court cases</h4>
            <hr>
            <div class=""></div>
            A mixed society may not have enough court cases for each sub community to have its own courthouse. As a result, they maintain and share one courthouse.

      <div class="">Path to Citizen Enforcement</div>
      <hide><hr><div class=""></div>
        In the internet age, it no longer takes an authority figure to determine if someone broke the law because video evidence exists and can be crosschecked by the whole town if needed. 
        <hr>
        <h4>Changes needed</h4>
        1) Open the prosecution process of simple violations so people could just submit, identify, review, and convict violators. <br>
        2) Reward people processing/reviewing cases on the open workforce. <br>
        3) Communicate the maximum reciprocative countermeasure that the violation allows. <br>
        <hr>
        <msg spk="Black">In general safety violations are eligible to be expelled because the community does not have a responsibility to keep itself safe, each individual has a responsibility to not put others in danger. Any individual who does not take the initiatives to protect others from themselves can be expelled. This doesn't mean if they are caught  speeding once past someone they get expelled, but the law should have a pathway where that is the eventual countermeasure. If the law doesn't have that pathway the law needs to change or have citizens opt in to waive their reciprocative rights to personal safety.</msg>
        <msg spk="Black">When a city does not enforce safety laws, does not let you enforce it, it is violating your autonomy unless you sign a waiver. </msg>
        <msg spk="Black">The reason why you can expel someone for safety violation has to do with what cities are under autonomy principles. A person who is expelled still own their share of resources and can join a city where speed limits are higher. It is about grouping people who want to go fast without helmet together. </msg>
        <msg spk="Black">The "reward" for the city that accepts high speed no helmet people is that essential they get the endorsement of that population to maintain its city size.</msg>

  <div class=""><b>At</b> Twitter there are many bookmarks with contents that can be added to the blog. What is a good strategy to add them?
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> This is the current process: When people reply, I get notifications. I bookmark every notification relevant to blog content.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Then I look at the bookmarks and pick some to reply. When a bookmark is taken care of, I remove the bookmark.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Then people reply to that and the loop continues. There are more bookmarks than I can reply.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think Red's guild score is underestimated because she is not getting enough points for replying.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I don't think each reply is worth a point. I get a point when I can relate it in the blog.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> How many bookmarks do you have now since yesterday?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> 21</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> And the day before?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> 19</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Tanya:</b> Conceptually, you want to be able to clear at least all bookmarks more you post. So the order of event should be:
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> You process bookmarked items to the blog first. When that happens, you remove the bookmark.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> When you have caught up in terms of bookmarks, then you post new content from the blog to Twitter.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Okay.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> So this is one of the thread on Poverty. The context: I was discussing about compassion, and discovered that someone, when they promote compassion, what they seem to mean is that if you are poor, you are the only one responsible to do better. That was somewhat shocking.
  
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> But they also say that they 
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I think they are double speaking.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think we can add a section to Compassionism node to diistinguish what we mean and what others may mean.</hide>
  <lnk>202209020848|üê£ Compassionism</lnk>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I have a question. If I remove a bookmark after addressing it in the blog, how do I know which tweet to reply when I deploy the content.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> The link should be in the blog already.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Does that mean there is no way but to add every bookmark as a link in the blog.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That was what I meant by the sighting section. You add all the links there from bookmarks. That means you don't need to bookmark them if you can add them directly.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Hmm...</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> That seems like a lot of work, to be honest. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think that is better than repeating the same topic to no effect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Instead of adding the link to the Blog, can I just add the link to Guild Log?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think that is up to you, but you will still need to add them to the blog because you need to cite them for the reader. And I would think it is easier to group them in the blog.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Hmm... I need a cache for the Sighting board. Archive 1 is too slow.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree please make a cache that combines the Sighting Board to Deployment areas.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Done!</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> So if I understand correctly, you want me to list all bookmarks since yesterday to the sighting board and remove the bookmark.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> Please also include a short description of its content.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Okay I'll try.</hide>
  <mbcomplete>Little Red added 14 links.</mbcomplete>
  <mbrec>Little Red Riding Hood is recognized as a Puller.</mbrec>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> It turned out to be not too difficult.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I added a date 20221203 because that is the date we should clear up to the next time.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Okay.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> So should I start updating Compassionism node?</hide>
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> The next step I recommend is that you define an asset in the staging area, which defines what section to add in the blog that will address the sightings.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Okay.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Now the staging are is very full.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Now we nuke them.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> After grouping them in the staging area, it is easy for anyone to add content to the blog.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> That's true.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Zoey:</b> I'll take poverty.
  <div></div><b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree please take a screenshot of the staging area for record.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Done!</hide>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Poverty casused by a victimization mindset is not poverty in our definition. Is that correct?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I am refering to Mag's comment. In our definition, poverty does not including a victim mindset.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> What do you mean by a victim mindset?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> 
  <button class="", and we have solutions for that, so I think it is part of poverty.</hide>

  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Evelyn:</b> Regarding the difference in definition of compassion, I don't think Michael has a different definition. I think it is a misunderstanding.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> But he confirmed that our definitions are 
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Ok. üòÖ</hide>
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I read it again and I still think that there is a misunderstanding. I don't think Michael is talking about a different definition. I think he misunderstood the context.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think he is imagining a situation where Ann believes that she is compassionate, and you are trying to judge that she is not.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> So if you present there to be two definition, it won't make sense.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think we need to keep asking questions to clarify.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Okay. 
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Is there a reason why we care if compassion is defined at the motivation of the result?
  <button class="".</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Okay. I think it might help if we list other motivations.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Good idea.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I read Michael's reply. I think it is just a case of definition creep. It is a logical fallacy of composition/division and moving the goal post.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't think we need to address that as an alternate definition of compassion.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That is content for LogFall Dungeon proper.</hide>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Do we have a go deploying a node on logical fallacies?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think we can first create the node then tone it down. I think we should deploy them because those fallacies would cloud people's vision.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Let's do Special Pleading / Moving the Goal Post.
  <lnk>202208011030|Special Pleading</lnk>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I think it is not special pleading, but an effect of anchoring bias. We either present it as a fallacy, or we take their word for it and present it as a definition.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe we have to present it as a definition after all. üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> But we can do it in a Logfall node instead of the compassion node.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> How about as an indoctrination tactic?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Terminology appropriation?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Yes.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think deploying it from that section would be even worse. üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Maybe we can start with a Venn diagram to confirm the difference between rights and compassion?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Then let's start with Black-or-white, and use compassions as an example. In black-or-white thinking, there are only two kinds of actions. When a person has black-or-white thinking, they can end up with definitions like Michael is using.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think that using that node is much better and can be educational.üòä</hide>
  <lnk>202208011038| Black-or-white</lnk>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> So, can I deploy the Black-or-white node?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think Effect 4 is the most problematic so I reworded it a little bit.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Do you want to rewrite it and put your avatar? I think if I write the whole thing, it gets too hot.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Okay. üòÖ</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think we also need a solution section.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Agreed.</hide>
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> So at this point, I first make a Twitter thread on Black-or-white fallacy, then I can reply by linking to it.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Yes.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I think Evelyn's solution section should go first because her tone is more helpful.</hide>

  <div class=""><b>December</b> calendar is now a node!  There should be no apparent difference when you browse except the December calendar page will be deleted!
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Its ID is not displayed, but calendar node ID's will have the format PYYYYMM000000!</hide>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> The reason for this change now is that Evelyn asked about it!
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Another reason for this change is that Ivy said we should move everything to nodes except content that we want to present as an article!</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> The reason is that the calendars are flooding the actual front page of the blog. So I think it is better to remove all of them. We could move all of them to Blogger Pages, but it is easier to archive if calendars are nodes.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I asked about it because I want to import old posts for the calendar. I know I can import regardless where the calendar is. I asked StarTree what it takes to change to using node starting January 2023. Thank you for making the change overnight!
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Wee~~!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> So was it easy to change to node?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree got 9 points for doing that!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> StarTree is already familiar with some of the bugs related to the calendar and was able to fix them quickly.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree made a copy thinking it will take a few days to change, but it seems okay so StarTree connected it to the actual calendar! November 2022 is still a post!</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Vivi:</b> If you are changing all of them to node, could you start with January 2022? That calendar is the most broken.

  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> ‚ö†Ô∏è The game content is rated "Age teen to adult"
  </div><hr class="">
  <mbmerit>Sasha gets Plot Twist 4</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> At the headquarters, Sasha analyzed the betting sheets found at Shark's office. They were all games where Rockneck missed key shots causing his team to lose to underdog teams. Mr. Shark confessed that he was there the night the victim died, but he said as soon as he found the body, he left. Mr. Shark said he was trying to help Rockneck with his debts.
  <button class="">üí°</div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think Shark has no motive to kill the victim. He is using Rockneck to make money.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> When the victim dies, what happens to her share from the will? Does it go to the husband or the sister?</hide>
  <button class="">üí°</div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I would think the husband.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think we are missing the evidene connecting the victim to the murderer. We need to find the source of the silk thread.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Do you think that is something the Secretary will have?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Quite possible.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I pick the headquarters for test results.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Tanya gets clue 247</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Tanya asked the victim's PD dispatcher for the copy of the anonymous tip, and asked StarTree to analyze the recording.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> The voice was disguised using a smart phone app! The original voice sounds like a woman!
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The three female suspects are the Sister Sergeant, the Secretary, and the Fan Stalker</hide>
  <button class="">üí°</div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> The person who called is not necessarily the murderer.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I would think normally if you are just a stranger caller you won't need to disguise your voice.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Not if you know who did it.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I'll finish the last clue with the Sister.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Ledia gets clue 283</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Back at the PD, Ledia was about to take the Sergeant back to headquarters when her phone rang. It was from Evelyn.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Ledia, I pinpointed the time of death through livor mortis. It was 9 PM.
  <div></div><b>Ledia:</b> "Where were you at 9 PM?" Ledia asks the Sister. "I was in a shift meeting after I left from the argument." "Can you prove that?" "Yes."
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> There you go, Zoey.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Alibi. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. So we have two other female suspects that we know almost nothing about.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I talk to the stalker.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Okay. My clue mentions something we didn't know about the Secretary. Anyone wants to do that first?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I take the Secretary clue.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Evelyn gets clue 68</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> In the first interview, after the Secretary interrupted Mr. Rockneck, Tanya brought the Secretary to another room.

  <mbmerit>P4 gets clue 93</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>P4:</b> While Sasha was interrogating Mr. Shark. Ivy, P4, and Evelyn were looking at the stuff P4 brought back from his office as evidence.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Isn't it odd that a man like him would own a self-help book?
  <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Is it? üòÖ
  <div></div><b>Ivy:</b> And this backpack. I don't think it is his...

  <button class="" below that listed the firstnames of THREE people: The husband, the wife, and the secretary. I also found a credit card receipt from the trash. That is the last clue from the crime scene.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Could you put the part that you could have found by yourself in CHAT?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Okay.</hide>
  <div></div><div class="", below that listed the firstnames of three people: Mr. Rockneck, his wife, and the secretary. Deeper in the trash was a credit card receipt.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> What is the point of the stationery? Are they reality TV stars or something?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> It sounds like something the secretary might order?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Right now we have one bonus clue, and we are one Arcacia Award short of another.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Ledia sings.</hide>
  <mbaa>Ledia receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> By the way, Magic Bakery now has a public youtube 
  <button class="" to the description to see if it will be searchable?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Done.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay, I misspoke. We are three AA short of getting the third bonus. The orignal game said it is impossible to get more than three bonus. I think we should keep that constraint.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> In any case we can only get to the last clue of just one more suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> This is hard. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> What if the receipt is for buying a scarf?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> How do we decide how to use the clue?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> There is no defined rule. You could go again if you want.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Well, if we meta game it, the last few clues were mostly about the four people in the game fixing group. I say we go all the way with the secretary.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Suppose the murderer is the secretary, revealing her clues will not tell us that she is the murderer, because the game will leave at least one other possible suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I think if we keep going we will understand how the clues are related. The bag has $300K in it. If that is her bag, is she giving it to someone, or is she about to receive it?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I see two votes for the Secretary.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think we are not necessarily just choosing a card based on the suspect, but a card that can give us information.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Which suspect would you pick to get a clue from?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't know. üòñ</hide>
  <button class="">üí°</div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think we have a better chance of getting negative proof if we go all the way with the stalker.</hide>
  <mbaa>Zoey receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> If we go all the way with the stalker, we might end up with only three possible suspects instead of four.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> We would have one spare clue if we get two more Arcacia Award.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Sasha sings.</hide>
  <mbaa>Sasha receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Do I see a 2 v 2 or is there no conflict?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think there is no conflict, we can continue with the stalker first.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I'll give that clue to Ivy, because she is waiting there.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Hold on. Isn't Ivy at HQ looking at evidence? XD Why is she also at the mental health center?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> *Facepalm*. Normally I wouldn't go visit the facility in person. I would have at least called first. Most likely not even that.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I just read from the clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> But you did choose to talk to the stalker. What were you thinking?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Because dad told me to go.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think you can still review evidence over the channel while you are waiting at the facility.</hide>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Nice save!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Now we know who is better at making excuses. XD</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Doesn't the stalker seem like an honest person?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Yes, I say we go all the way with the stalker. XD</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree got the call from Ivy and sent Red to bring the Stalker back to HQ.
  <div></div><div class=""
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> If she it right then the murder can only be the secretary. Tanya's plan is working. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> It might be working for the game, but our story will make no sense if we intentionally don't follow the probable suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Let's continue first. We still have one clue left.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> The Stalker didn't exactly say she saw the murder. And since we cannot go all the way with the Secretary, if we choose the secretary we will only get a clue that we already know.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> We haven't heard from Mr. Dragon the whole game.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Let's choose Mr. Dragon. XD</hide>
  <mbmerit>Zoey gets clue 123</mbmerit>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I'll give that clue to Evelyn or Red.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay, folks! Time to decide your suspect!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Is it really necessary to spread out? Can't we just all win and level up?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I actually like the idea of spreading out, I think it is less stressful. üòÖ I pick Mr. Dragon.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I pick the Stalker.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Instead of splitting the credit, could everyone who guesses right just get 1 point?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> That doesn't account for when a case is simple.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Well, the good detective should be able to get the simple cases also. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Compelling.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> But then who will be our backup if our main guess is wrong?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> You could just say the Hospitalian Knights got the correct suspect if that makes you feel better. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Also compelling.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. So in this case, who wouldn't pick the Secretary?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> The Secretary does seem the most suspicious. üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Especially after questioning the Stalker. I think she is a credible witness.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> So are you all okay if it turns out to be someone else? It will go on record as a TPK.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I would rather prevent a TPK than to be right myself. üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I will cover the Sergeant, in case she lied about the Alibi.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> P4 will follow the Shark.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I think my dad can cover the Stalker if Red wants to cover the husband.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Ok</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree picks the Secretary, Wee~!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay, now we have 5 people on the Secretary. If she is the culprit, those 5 people get 0.2 points each, and Zoey will take the lead with 0.7 points.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> We can now see the rest of the clues, starting with the husband.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Little Red gets clue 133 and 154</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class="". When he was asked about that phrase, he said as a matter of fact that that is the title of a book and everyone who knows the wife knew that book, and he saw the secretary has a copy once.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> That was it.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> The clue about firing is important.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Next let's reveal the remaining clue for Dragon.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Evelyn gets clue 265</mbmerit>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I'm going to RP this part. üòÖ</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I forgot to mention that on the night of the murder, Mr. Rockneck was in a basketball game and his team lost. That was part of his third clue.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> <i>That</i> is important.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I would say this case makes more sense than the last one. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Now let's reveal the remaining clues for the Secretary. I will give them to StarTree</hide>
  <mbmerit>StarTree gets clues 173 and 232</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> The third clue is when the Secretary called our headquarters to arrange a meeting. At a meeting with her, she said she wanted to distant Rockneck and his friends, because she thinks that they have a scheme related to the victim's murder. Then her phone rang, but she looked at the number and hung up.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> The last clue is that the lab traced the barcode on the book from Shark's office to a purchase online by credit card owned by the secretary. The secretary was questioned, and said she bought a copy because the victim kept talking about it, but she didn't like that book.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> What about the silk threads...</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Probably in the solution.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Solution</mbmerit>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It is the Secretary!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Motive: The Secretary wants money to support her own lavish lifestyle, and tried to make herself important in the Rockneck household so that they cannot be without her. When she overheard the game-fixing scheme, she wanted to be part of it. However, her sense of self-important was hated by the wife, especially when the secretary ordered letterhead including herself as part of the household. The wife threw that into the trash. That night, the secretary saw the gun the sister left and killed the wife out of anger.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Shortly after: The secretary decided to frame Shark because she knew the game-fixing scheme will probably end anyway.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The solution did not mention who made the call and what the silk was about. I think it is implied that the secretary called the PD about the gun and somehow left silk threads on the victim.</hide>
  <button class=""!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Current scores: 0.7 points: Zoey. 0.5 points: Sasha. 0.2 points: StarTree, Ledia, Tanya, Ivy.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Please return for the next case!</hide>

  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> ‚ö†Ô∏è The game content is rated "Age teen to adult"
  </div><hr class="">
  <mbmerit>Sasha gets Plot Twist 1</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> A murder has been discovered at the restroom of a bar. The victim has been identified. Who wants to investigate?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The choices for clues are: 1) Crime scene, 2) HQ, 3) The Bartender who called, 4) Victim's Wife, 5) Victim's Son, and 6) Another suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think starting at the crime scene would be normal.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Ledia gets clue 87 (Crime&nbsp;Scene&nbsp;1)</mbmerit>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That was meant to be a comment. But I'll take the clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> First come first serve.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Hmm... The clue said absolutely nothing important.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Ledia is on scene now.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> XD Really?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> So I was thinking, if we want to be efficient with this game, we would intentionally skip the bartender because most likely he will just say something that introduce us to the other suspects. But in the game we could skip ahead to other suspects.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> We might be able to also skip the crime scene. Since most of the time the lab will mention what we found at the crime scene.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Wouldn't that be really confusing? The storyline will be scrambled.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> You could consider that part of the challenge.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think finding the intended sequence is part of the fun for Ledia.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> But that didn't work very well just now? Ledia got a clue with nothing in it.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> But the content of that clue seems to be in the correct chronological order.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Do we have a problem?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think we are trying to see if we should try to follow a story order or try to skip ahead.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think you can just do what you want?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> But if I choose one way or the other, it spoils the fun for the other. üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> In any case we are only talking about skipping the crime scene and the bartender. Will that really change the story that much?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I guess not...? üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> My objection to that was, if we skip ahead, we will get more situations where we don't know what the clues mean. We already got situations in the last game where we wait for someone else to pick a clue before RPing our own clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I don't think that was a good example. If we did spread out then it wouldn't happen. The game expected us to spread out.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> So. What type of solution do we want? Split the game for two teams? Alternate the play style?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Can we try to get a clue from each location?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree wants to get a clue from HQ.</hide>
  <mbmerit>StarTree gets clue 285 (HQ&nbsp;1)</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree wishes the detectives good luck!
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree also got a useless clue!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Could it be that this case is just shorter, so the designers ran out of things to put?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Bartender please. üôè</hide>
  <mbmerit>Evelyn  gets clue 166 (Bartender&nbsp;1)</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Evelyn arrived on scene to talk to the bartender. The victim was a regular customer which the bartender knew him by name. The bartender said he found the body while closing up. There was a lot of blood but no knife. According to the bartender, the victim never caused any trouble, except unpaid bar tab. I should also mention that the bar seems to be in a dangerous district.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> That didn't actually tell us much did it?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I guess that's true. üòÖ</hide>
  <button class="" XD</hide>
  <mbmerit>Zoey gets clue 120 (Toadstool&nbsp;1)</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class="" was a little understated, Zoey said on the channel, that area is known for corruption where drug lords try to control the government. One of those drug lords is Mr. Toadstool. However, those corruption is being kept at bay due to a neighboring country giving support. Our victim happens to be from that neighboring country.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I am sold. We have at least a motive there.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> The other another suspect.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Tanya gets clue 112 (Viper&nbsp;1)</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Tanya watched the surrounding quietly and noticed a man with a glass eye that has a profile at Hospitalian Knights database. That man, Viper, is a runner for the drug lord Toadstool. It is rumored that he lost an eye as a punishment, and he has been looking for opportunities to prove himself since.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Last clue for round 1. Choices are 1) Victim's wife, 2) Victim's son, 3) Another suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> Another suspect.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Casey gets clue 96 (Daisy&nbsp;1)</mbmerit>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Casey:</b> Casey happens to be questing nearby and saw the team on a case. Sitting with Ledia, they overheard a conversation between the bartender and a pretty woman. The woman asked about the victim, and the bartender said he will be back tomorrow. At that, the woman looked surprised and left.
  <div></div><div class="" said the bartender.
  <button class="">üí°</div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think the woman is surprised because she and the victim had arranged to meet today.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> And that's all for this round! Please return for Plot Twist 2!</hide>

  <mbmerit>Zoey gets clue 13 (Son&nbsp;1)</mbmerit>
  <mbclue>[13] Victim's Son</mbclue>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> At the station, Zoey talked to the son who seemed to have adapted really well to the new country since his dad's promotion. However, she felt that the couple had a problem before they moved to this country.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Viper</hide>
  <mbmerit>Tanya gets clue 203 (Viper&nbsp;2)</mbmerit>
  <mbclue>[203] Minion Viper</mbclue>
  <div></div><div class="" Tanya said on the channel.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> I'll go.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> How good are you in speaking spanish?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> I can only name some dishes in Spanish, like taco, burrito... üòÇ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Please come.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>44:</b> At the address from the ripped notes, a man shows up with a small package in hand.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That is Viper. The drug lord's minion.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> What do we do? Do we arrest him?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Yes, he is suspected of drug trafficking. We can arrest him.</hide>
  <div></div><b>44:</b> 44 casually walks near the man. Despite 44's manner and outfit could easily pass as a local person, when the man saw 44, the man panics and runs. 44 easily takes him down.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Two more clues for this round. Choices: Crime scene, HQ, Bartender, Drug Lord.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Red picks the drug lord.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Red gets clue 138 (Druglord&nbsp;2)</mbmerit>
  <mbclue>[138] Drug Lord Toadstool</mbclue>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Red is trying to catch up on this case, but when Zoey mentioned that Toadstool is a drug lord, she got sidetracked and looked him up. It seems that he has been buying as much property as he can through a front man.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Last clue of this round.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> HQ please.</hide>
  <mbmerit>Evelyn gets clue 263 (HQ&nbsp;2)</mbmerit>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think Daisy's clue comes before my clue.</hide>
  <mbclue>[181] Prostitute Daisy</mbclue>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Amelia:</b> That night, Amelia and 44 went to the bar to stake out the prostitute Daisy. When Daisy arrived, she went straight to the restroom. Amelia and 44 followed. When Daisy saw that 44 was wearing a gun, she whips out a razor to slash 44. Amelia pins Daisy to the ground.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think we missed a clue from the restroom.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Very likely.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think that is the expected result when we skip the crime scene. The evidence in the restroom would prbably be mentioned in another clue. Or it may be the reason why we decide to stake out Daisy and arrest her when she goes to the restroom.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think it might be too confusing if we don't try to act in the way we would as detectives.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> But for the game it is work because we still got Daisy in custody. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Why don't we just reveal all clues in each round except the last round? Then we will never be behind. In the last round, we will get only two free clues.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That is not a bad idea.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That is the same as using the worst strategy.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think it will still be a fun and fair challenge even if we use the worst strategy. The major up-sides are we are not cheating overall, and the story will be a lot easier to follow.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Yes we are still getting 24 free clues. That sounds fair.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I am okay with such change, especially when we have already discovered the strategy to only get vital clues by gaming the game.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I am for making the game <i>harder</i>. If making the game harder also gives us an easier story to follow, that is a bonus.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I see.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Then may I get check the crime scene again?</hide>
  <mbmerit>Ledia gets clue 245 (Crime&nbsp;scene&nbsp;2)</mbmerit>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> The clue is not about the bar but the victim's office.</hide>
  <mbclue>[245] Crime Scene</mbclue>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ledia:</b> Among the evidence Tanya gathered from the victim's office was his laptop. There was nothing extraordinary in the laptop except a folder filled with one-sentence coded symbols.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I haven't said my clue yet. But I think my clue will be last for this round so I'll wait.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Totally forgot about Evelyn's clue. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> If we don't say our clue at the same time we get them, maybe the purple text should display when we actually say the clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> @StarTree, could you make a new tag for clue with a magnifying glass symbol?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Done!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I will just take the bartender clue to try it.</hide>
  <mbclue>[194] Bartender</mbclue>
  <div></div><div class="" 'Margarita' refers to Daisy, not the drink, Sasha believes.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I did some gymnatstics there because the clue is supposed to be before the arrest. I don't think it changes the meaning if I put it like this.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> May I just take both clues from the mother and son to keep things going? XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Is this a problem? now we really need nine players to get through the first three rounds, but only 3 players for the last round.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think we have enough players.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Not a problem then.</hide>
  <mbclue>[143] Victim's Son</mbclue>
  <div></div><div class="" when she cries. I must not have understood that clearly during the interview. But from the transcript, I can only interpret that to mean the victim wanted to keep the marriage only because he needs to be married to keep his job. Isn't the victim just a navy officer? He can still keep his job after a divorce. Does he have another job where he needs to be married?
  <mbclue>[175] Victim's Wife</mbclue>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> Reviewing the transcript with the victim's wife, it seems that the wife was quite concerned about her son's safety. I suppose that could be normal to assume that the murderer wasn't only targeting the husband but her entire family. She also asked about when she could pick up the body. We might have to tell her about it tomorrow.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I must admit. The scrambling is bad for RP. LOL. It made it so hard. XD. It is one thing if we just decide to never get clues from a suspect, but if we have to RP it in retrospect it is hard. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That's what I said. üòâ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> And my clue.</hide>
  <mbclue>[263] Headquarters</mbclue>
  <div></div><div class="" that was carved across the victim's windpipe, but Evelyn will need the lab to determine the circumstance when the victim was attacked.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> "Bring this back to the lab, too" Sasha said, and hands Evelyn the razor confiscated from Daisy.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Those are ALL of the clues from Round 1 and 2. There are four rounds total. Is it possible that Daisy was not the murder?? We have only reach the halfway point of the case!</hide>

      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> XD</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Chronologically, the third clue from the bartender happened before I gave the razor to Evelyn to bring back to HQ. Actually I think that scene would happen before plot twist 2.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> We noticed that since game 1 when I was playing with Tanya. We did not read the game rules wrong. It is impossible to reach clue #3 in round 1 because each agent has to be sent to a different card. This clue I will give to Tanya.</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> So, who is first?</hide>
      <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Red, then interview with Daisy, Wife and Son, then Viper, then Crime Scene.</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> After the interviews, the suspects were allowed to leave the station. Later, the drug lord's minion Viper is found dead in a back alley with bullet holes in his forehead, both of his wrists, and several in his chest.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Completely different style of murder.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> We did take the scissors. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. So in this round, we only have two free clues. For every six Arcacia Awards we can get one bonus clue, up to three bonus clues.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Meanwhile, I am doing some mindblowing upgrades to the script maker that I am in awe of myself.</hide>
  <mbrec>Sasha is recognized for Spell Crafting.</mbrec>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Are we skipping the autopsy result? üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think it is quite likely that a clue from the Wife or HQ will rule out a suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think now is the time I would defer to strategists to decide which clue to take. **Evelyn Sings**</hide>
  <mbaa>Evelyn receives</mbaa>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think the only three possible suspects are the bartender, the wife, and the son. If the scissors are not the murder weapon, the murderer may be the bartender, who might have been lying. I will be okay with spending the first free clue on HQ.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I am also okay with revealing the HQ clue.</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Evelyn determined that the wound at the victim's neck was done by a pair of scissors. And the lab reported that there was traces of blue liquid around the wound. The liquid is identified to be barbacide.

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think the wife and son's clue have about equal chance of disproving one of them. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I'll pick the son because the game is driving us toward the mom.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [134] Victim's Son</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""He has many of those, said the son.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think the implication is that those logins corresponded to last summer. They are not recent. Therefore, there is no evidence that the son knew about the most recent meeting where we caught Viper.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> All evidences point to the wife.</hide>

  <div></div><div class="">üíó</div><b>P4:</b> Could you ask the son if he knows the difference between the words for 'cut' and 'shoot' in Spanish?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> That seems so random, I don't know anymore. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> How many AA are we from a second bonus clue?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I count 4. You need 4 more for second bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> What are you thinking?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Maybe there is a clue on Viper's body.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think it is time for each player to choose a suspect.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Then could you cover Viper for me. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> Sure.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Now the big question: Who should I pick? I guess I will go with Tanya and pick the wife since everything about the son is even more speculation. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree picks the son to avoid rounding off 1/3!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay, now we will reveal the remaining clues. The order wlll be Drug Lord, Daisy, Bartender, Viper, and the Wife.</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> On the first day, the detectives pressed on to ask the bartender if there was anyone else he had not seen on the night the victim was murdered. But the bartender said there was no one new. He had  seen everyone there that night,including the drug dealers hanging around outside.
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [2] Viper</div><hide><hr>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> I'll give this clue to 44.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""The method that Lord Toadstool uses to execute people is a cut across the forehead, chest, and wrists.
  <div></div><div class="" P4 was not listening to the case and had no idea what Ivy was talking about.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Suppose the son is the murderer, is this clue suggesting that he tried to make the murder look like an execution by Lord Toadstool. He skipped school because he was a wannabe drug dealer joining Toadstool, but he didn't know exactly how Toadstool would have someone executed?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That would mean the bartender saw the son on that night. The bartender just didn't know that the son is the victim's son. If the bartender has been truthful.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> How old is the son? üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> 17</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I have a hard time picturing it.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> There is still one more clue. Who is doing the clue for the wife?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Ledia picked the wife first.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [108] Victim's Wife</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think that points more toward the son being the murderer than the wife. It is as if the wife knew the son killed the father. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Well well well, time to reveal the truth!</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">‚öñÔ∏è SOLUTION</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> It is the son!
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Motive: The son loves his mom and suspected his dad of doing something bad and started investigating. He found two things: 1) That his dad is selling out his country, and 2) his dad is cheating on his mom. So he did the father in.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Means: The son used his mom's scissors. He thought that he could blame it on the infamous drug lord, but he did not know that the drug lord had a specific way of execution.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The implication there being, when the son discovered that Toadstool's method of execution was to shoot people, the son lied to the detectives.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Opportunity: The son simply stalked out his dad, followed him to the restroom in the bar and killed him.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Aftermath: The son was prosecuted as an adult, but the defense was successful in arguing that he did a great service to the country and could be considered a hero if he had been in the proper team. The jury was convinced and he received the minimum sentence possible.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Aside: Viper and Daisy were executed by the drug lord because they were caught.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> With that, the current scores are <b>0.7:</b> Zoey. <b>0.5:</b> Sasha, <b>0.45:</b> Ivy, StarTree. <b>0.25:</b> 44, P4. <b>0.2:</b> Ledia, Tanya.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Would it be too much to ask to multiply all scores by 100?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> In my mind a 1 means a level 1 detective.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Can anyone even get to 1? XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Please return for the next case!</hide>

    <div class=""><b>This</b> is about drafting for Chapter 16 Page 10.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> On page 9, a monster has spawned from a card. I haven't shown Sasha yet. What should happen next?</hide>
    </div><hr class="">
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I think... we need to do something to determine if the monster is friend or foe. For example, we need to know if the gas it is spraying is poisonous, and if we should just avoid it or do something about it.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I really want to avoid a situation where we are apparently practicing to destroy wild life. üòÖ</hide>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> I feel that we are back to square one. It goes back to healing versus destroying. Evelyn is okay if we are healing things, but not when we are destroying things.
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> I have an idea where within the mist, we can see crystal. Then for each crystal we need to determine if it is poisonous or not.
    <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> And what does it mean when it is poisonous?
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> That would mean it hurts people around it. 
    <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> But those are words and concepts, how would they hurt people? Do you mean when the message is insulting?
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't know yet. üòñ</hide>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> The original context of the dungeon was to identify logical fallacies and when we find them, we can mercilessly destroy them. 
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> But if they are representing as being, the option should be to heal them. If they can't destroy us, we shouldn't try to destory them. As you said, those are messages. If they are bad messages, and we heal them, they can become good messages.</hide>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Should we try some items from the staging area?
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> The last thing I was working on was cherry-picking. I haven't deployed yet because the tone seemed off.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Let's clean it up.</hide>
    <div></div><div class=""
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> With that prompt I wrote a lot explaining why that is cherry-picking.</hide>
    <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> For my understanding, are we saying the turtle is now a monster that spawns other monsters? The dark mist it creates turns people into non-thinking or wrong-thinking beings. Then if you focus on something specific, you an see a message.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> And as a peacemaker you need to first decide whether that message is part of the problem lowering people's rationale.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think it should be something like that.</hide>
    <div></div><b>Evelyn:</b> According to the schema that Black put there: The speaker used an example where a sellers who profits from a problem has no incentive to solve a problem. While Red gives an example where a for-profit buyer affected by such problem has an incentive to solve the problem. When the two are considered, since for every seller there must be at least a buyer, and a for-profit victim would want the problem solved, the conclusion by the speaker is either false or at least not as easily determined. 
    <div></div><b>3B:</b> So I am picturing, as you read into the mist and casts a spell, the mist starts to take form as a cherry. Your spell brings to it its lost cherry friends. Once they reunit, they are happy and together they can fend off others who try to pick them apart.
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think that could be a cute idea.</hide>
    <button class="". How about a blindfolded small dragon that is isolated and attacks things around it?</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think I can draw that.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> For the cherry-picking node, I want to first add a section describing the cause and how we could help.</hide>
    <mbcomplete>Evelyn added a cause section to the Cherry-Picking node.</mbcomplete>
    <lnk>#P202208011050|üçí Cherry Picking</lnk>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I will take me some time to process it.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't think it is necessary to show all of that in the manga, but there might be a situation where our countermeasure does not work, my response would be based on that understanding.</hide>
    <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Thank you, I will think about it.</hide>
    <mbkudo>3B thanks all for the ideas.</mbkudo>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Robert:</b> On the night of the murder, after Robert showed the photo of Ex-119 but nobody recall having seen him at the reunion, the guests were allowed to leave, but were asked to remain available for the next few days. Meanwhile, the psych ward where Mr. Bingo resides confirmed that Mr. Bingo did not return until 11 PM that night. 
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Here's the deal. for every clue that we choose not to reveal, we get a free clue in round 4.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> In other words, we are back to how the game is played out of the box. There are ten free clues left between round 3 and 4.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> If we had followed the official game rule, in this round we would get Plot Twist 4 after using four clues. Is that true? Getting Plot Twist 4 will save us from wasting clues. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think that is fine. After revealing the fourth clue, Plot twist 4 will be revealed.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I thought the plan was to reveal all clues so that the story will make more sense and the game will be harder.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> But it seems that the timeline is already broken. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think in the way I post now, I can just rearrange them after a clue is revealed.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That's true.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> So, now the choices are more important, and I hope that makes it more exciting!</hide>

  <div class="">üîç [17] Mr. Bingo</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class="" says Robert, as he reaches for his handcuffs.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I don't believe it is Mr. Bingo. I don't think this is how the game works. XD We must find a second suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> We have three more clues before plot twist 4.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> If I understand correctly, at round 4 we will have 6 free clues, but since we will have only revealed 4 clues in round 3, at least one of the clues in round 4 will be a round 3 clue. Is that correct?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Yes, you will need to use a free clue to catch up on a clue from round 3.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't think there is any result pending from the lab. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> We still need to know who the second man was. I think we still have a good chance to get a clue from the crime scene or HQ.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> if we can only pick one I would say HQ.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> By now I would think that they are all the same. It seems to be just up to our preference. There will probably be overlapping clues.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Then we could just roll dice and stick with it?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I want to pick Imposter #2 because I don't think anyone else knows him.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> How old is Imposter #2?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> The clue didn't say.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Maybe being old is a clue that he is not the second man.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I see.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> Then that leaves only Ex-Jock versus Mr. Bingo.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think it is safer to get a clue from HQ first, <i>because</i> we have nothing pending from the HQ. So if HQ in fact has something, then it will be a meaningful clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Compelling.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I pick HQ.</hide>
  </hide></div>  
  <div class="">üîç [56] Headquarters</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> The lab result is that the second man seems to have very low reproductive vitality.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Case closed? XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Since a suspect normally won't give us incriminating evidence on themself, this would mean we don't reveal a clue from Imposter #2.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> But this is only Round 3. What if he has an alibi?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> What if the Ex-Jock is also infertile?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> In reality we would just get DNA sample from both.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That doesn't show the second man also killed the victim.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> True. Unless you can pinpoint the time of their act to coincide with the time of death. ü§î</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Do you think the Best Friend has more gossips?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I was last asking her about her bruises. I think her clue #3 will talk about that.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I think it might be worth checking the crime scene because it appears that the HQ result would not overlap with a clue from the crime scene.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> But It could overlap with a suspect clue. If we directly review a suspect clue, there is a chance that we don't need to reveal a crime scene clue. But when we reveal a crime scene clue, we don't know who that clue is associated with.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think that just happened when we revealed about the low vitality clue, we don't really <i>know</i> who has low vitality except Imposter #2 is referred to as being old.</hide>
  <button class="" were on different clue cards. It takes two separate clues to make a connection. So if the game was designed correctly, a clue from the crime scene should not be redundant. It will give you half of an association. If you just reveal a suspect card, it would not be enough for you to know that there is an association.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That is compelling <i>if</i> the game is designed like that. And I hope that it is designed like that, then we don't have to meta game.</hide>
  <button class="" are close enough.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [254] Crime Scene</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class="" laments Ivy. The content of the laptop confirms that Mr. Sweetheart likes it rough. 
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I'm sorry. It was a flop. The clue is not a duplicate but is useless. We never doubted that Mr. Sweetheart can be rough if he had said so himself.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Last clue before Plot Twist 4!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> If the game tells us that Imposter #2 is fertile, it must also give us a clue on who is infertile. I don't think we can get that clue from Imposter #2. If a clue from Imposter #2 tells us that he is infertile that would be our guess already, and without revealing clues about other suspect, we would not know if that condition is unique to him. Therefore, in both cases we should not spend a clue on Imposter #2. The bruises on the Best Friend might be a red herring, suggesting that the victim died during a fight with her best friend. But we are not suspecting the murderer to be a woman. And if the best friend was the murderer, she could have kept the gun instead of leaving it on scene. So I pick Ex-Jock for a clue.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [6] Ex-Jock</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> So long as Ex-Jock or other suspects don't tell us they are infertile, my only suspect is Imposter #2. </hide>
  <button class=""? Then we <i>only</i> need to reveal his clues intead of everyone else.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> But if he <i>does</i> tell us, we have no other suspect. So my point is, we might as well assume that he <i>will</i> tell us he is fertile, so we start looking for a second suspect earlier.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Hmm...</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Why did you ask that question, Ledia? I thought I understood the strategy now I am confused, but it sounds like Tanya knows what she is doing. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Tanya is saying, because she thinks that Imposter #2 is the murderer, therefore we should assume that his clue will tell us he is not the murderer, so we should start looking for an alternative murder suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Correct.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> It makes no sense.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It doesn't make sense in real life. It makes sense in this game because we <i>know</i> the murderer is one of the suspects, and the game would not make us eliminate each suspect without also giving us something that associate them to the murder. So if the game bothers to give Imposter #2 an alibi, then the game must give us another clue on which of the other men is infertile. It is a meta-gaming strategy.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> So, if we reveal that another suspect is infertile, do we then assume that Imposter #2 is fertile? Or should we confirm or look for a second clue to pick out which infertile man is the murderer?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think there aren't more vital clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> But this is only round 3. We still have one more twist.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think it is time to review Plot Twist 4.</hide>

  <div class="">‚≠ê PLOT TWIST 4</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Ledia previously asked who discovered the body. We checked the call record, it was the Janitor who discovered the body. He had just finished sweeping the hallway and was moving on to the boys' locker room when he found the body.
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> Meanwhile, StarTree looked into the Chickenhawk chat room that the victim frequented. It is a popular forum for people who want to join but do not qualify, to fantasize about joining the military!
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> This twist is revealed after 4 clues from plot twist 3 were revealed. There are six free clues left, which can be spent on remaining clues from Round 3 or Round 4.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Is the janitor one of the suspect?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I think if he is a suspect he could only be Mr. Bingo. Everyone else came as a guest, and Ex-119 is supposed to be a writer.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> May I finish the last clue from the lab?</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [277] Headquarters</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Evelyn says on the channel that low reproductive vitality can be caused by malnutrition, smoking, obesity, radiation, and even bicycling.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Did the clue specifically not mention age?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> The clue does not mention age. üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> No suspect has any of those qualities so far.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Five free clues left.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [28] Mr. Bingo</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class="" says Mr. Bingo. 
  <div></div><div class="" says Mr. Bingo.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I would say his explanation could be possibly be confirmed by other witnesses. I would consider Bingo clear of suspicion even if he would kill someone to keep his secret.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Four free clues left.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Let's finish Ex-Jock.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [49] Ex-Jock</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> No hit at all.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That is within expectation if Imposter #2 is the murderer.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Little Red Riding Hood wants to go after the murder instead of eliminating alternate suspects. üê£</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Three free clues left.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> May I standby for the crime scene?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> What do you mean?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> You are going to have us guess, then reveal all clues before revealing the solution, right? I want to RP the crime scene if no one reveals it before our guesses.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. I'll let you standby.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> May I standby for Imposter #2?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I guess so. We still have three free clues.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I'll take a clue from Best Friend.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I suppose we should use it on Ex-119 if we don't want to waste it.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [71] Best Friend</div><hide><hr>
    <h4>Round 3 Clue</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> We revealed this clue after Plot Twist 4 was revealed.</hide>
  </hide></div>  
  <div class="">üîç [9] Best Friend</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class="" The best friend seems shaken as she realized that the victim was murdered shortly after she fled. Zoey hands her a pen to sign her testimony. The best friend signed it with her left hand.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> One free clue left.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [237] Ex-119</div><hide><hr>
  <h4>Round 3 clue</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree looked at the photos taken when the guests arrived at the entrance, and noticed a blue pickup truck with someone in the driver's seat the whole time! The license plate is registered to Mr. Ex-119!
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> OMG. Let's sing! XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> We are three AA short of a bonus clue. Who say we should just end now and start guessing?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think it would be more exciting if we just guess now.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Robert:</b> Not the best friend.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I'll cover the best friend.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I think there is no reason to 'cover' her. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I would rather avoid a TPK... üôè</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> If I sing enough to get a bonus clue, could you make the guess first, then I get one more clue before making a choice?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> *Evelyn Sings*</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Let's see. Do I want excitement or a better chance to get detective credits? I want excitement.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Please choose now. Those who contribute to the bonus clue may change their mind after a bonus clue is revealed.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> And to avoid TPK, only one player is needed to cover all unpopular suspects. So if all of us choose Imposter #2 or Ex-119, and the murderer turns out to be someone else, Evelyn will get the credit. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> That seems more fair.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Robert:</b> Ex-119 is my first choice. 
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> One AA short for a bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I will get the bonus clue. 
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Everyone else please confirm your guess first.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Currently there are five on Imposter #2 and Ex-119, Evelyn covers the rest! StarTree is stuck with Ex-119 if his last clue turns out to be his alibi! üò≠</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> StarTree may use my bonus contribution if she wants to switch. ü§ó</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Wee~~!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay, now we reveal the last clue of Ex-119.</hide>
  </hide></div>  
  <div class="">üîç [64] Ex-119</div><hide><hr>
    <h4>Bonus Clue</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> False alarm! üò≠</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It seems that everyone picks Imposter #2. Except Evelyn.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Robert:</b> Any smokers? I don't think I saw any.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Are you sticking with Ex-119?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Robert:</b> Yes.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> No one else ever mentioned a smoker.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> There are 9 players on Imposter #2. üò≠</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> The scoring method is bad. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> Why don't you do scoring based on the number of players who do not get it right? So in this case, if Robert and Evelyn are the only two not getting it right, then those who get it right score two points each.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> That makes more sense to me, but poor Evelyn. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Evelyn will get 10 points if it turns out to be one of the four other suspects.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Yes, but we all know that won't happen. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Playing stress free is worth something to me. üòä</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Now the choices are set. We will reveal the remaining clues. Starting with Sweetheart, Crime Scene, then Imposter #2.</hide>  
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">ü•Å [200] Sweetheart</div><hide><hr>
  <h4>Unused Round 3 Clue</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> After confessing that he had cheated on his wife that night, Sasha asked Mr. Sweetheart if they could search his car. Mr. Sweetheart's car smells freshly cleaned. In the trunk was a laptop. Sweetheart reluctantly agreed the detectives to take it for investigation, hoping that his cooperation may keep them from interviewing his wife.

  <div class="">ü•Å [226] Imposter #2</div><hide><hr>
    <h4>Unused Round 4 Clue</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree looks into the webcast that Mr. Imposter mentioned at the Chickenhawk chat room, but could not confirm the recording time of webcasts because all of the webcasts are pre-recorded!
  <hr class="">
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üõéÔ∏è SOLUTION</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> The murderer is Imposter #2!
  <div></div><b>Motive:</b> He wanted revenge for being exposed as an imposter after the victim's trial subpoenaed him as a witness. That ruined his life.
  <div></div><b>Opportunity:</b> He learned about the victim's reunion from the chat room. He arrived at around 10 PM and stayed around the edge of the gym until he saw the victim and the best friend leave to the locker room. He was the one who smoked a cigarette while waiting. Unknown to the detectives at that time, Imposter #2 is undergoing chemo therapy for cancer.
  <div></div><b>Means:</b> After the best friend fled the locker room, he crepted inside and tried to strange her, but the victim put up a fight. He was knocked down and discovered the gun that the best friend left behind. He knew firing the gun would draw attention, so he hit the victim with the butt of the gun. He wiped the gun afterward and briefly rejoined the reunion crowd. He planned to only wait a brief period, but by the time he tried to leave, the place was locked down.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> For the scoring...  Black, Ivy, Ledia, LRRH, P4, Sasha, StarTree, Tanya, Zoey, got the culprit for 2 points each, or in the old scoring, 0.11 points each. Zoey still has the lead at 0.81 points! </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> That's all for this case! Please return for the next one!</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> A combat veteran is found dead in a one-car crash on his way to work, which is to buy prosthetics for the navy. His own prosthetic arm is on the seat next to him. The detectives are called in to investigate if this was an accident. As they arrived, they spot something in the snow next to the car...
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> For this case, I want to the original game rule where we will reveal only six clues per round. Doing this will make round 4 a lot longer, so that will be split into two rounds. The fifth round will start with player's guesses then bonus clues, followed by drumroll and solution.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> It doesn't say on my clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> But are we safe to assume that it crashed into ditch, the side barrier or a tree? That the other object of the collision is missing from the scene?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I don't think we can assume that. It is possible that the other car in the collision fled.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> May I reveal the HQ clue to see if he has been drugged?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Yes.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> What about the strategy of revealing only crime scene or HQ?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I don't see Tanya here, and I think if we could attribute the overwhelming win to Tanya, I think that strategy would make the game too easy. Please make it more challenging, Evelyn.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> And I agree that there seem to be too much gaps in the plot. I think I prefer revealing all clues for each round and get only two free clues in Round 4. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I agree with Ledia.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Next case we'll go back to revealing all clues in each round until Round 4.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think we should reveal the four fourth round clues first, then decide on which suspect we should catch up.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Then I start with the lab.</hide>

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> Ivy informs the detectives that nitric acid is not too difficult to make by anyone who can search for the recipe online. The ingredients include hydrochloric acid and nitric salt, like Chilean saltpeter, which is also found in rock salt, and copper. 
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I suppose the victim was conscious when the car crashed. üòñ</hide>

  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Well, it seems that we might not need to talk to Ms. Last Caller if the person who will do the murder is Prey #2. I continue with the car owner.</hide>

  <div class="">üîç [188] Car Owner</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> If I understand this correctly, his answer is a negative evidence because sulfuric is acid is made of sulfur and nitric acid is made of nitrogen.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> You can make nitric acid from sulfuric acid. Nitric acid is HNO<sub>3</sub>. The acid part (H) can come from HCl Hydrochloric acid or H<sub>2 </sub>SO<sub>4</sub> Sulfuric acid.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Well then. Inconclusive.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> As I said, the ingredients to make it is not too difficult to obtain. Anyone who have some understanding or familiarity of chemistry can do that. Your Car Owner suspect normally uses chemical, so he might be above average in his familiarity in handling or mixing chemicals.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Do you mean he shouldn't have burned his hand unless he was trying to make something he wasn't familiar with?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> That's too much speculation for me to comment.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Fair enough.</hide>
  <button class="" from Ivy is not very convincing. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> If we can't eliminate any suspect, this case would be quite interesting.</hide>

  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [109] Prey #2</div><hide><hr>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> If the last caller knows where the victim lives, he has opportunity also.</hide>

  <div class="">üîç [161] Last caller</div><hide><hr>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Covering doesn't sound so bad. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Prey #2 also. I don't see a motive for the car owner.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Prey #2. At least he is one of the three in Sirius' vision.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Prey #2. He seems to have both ingredients, and the bag of Chilean product seems to be recent and not belong to the work place. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Compelling.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I'm sold. Prey #2.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Fine. Prey #2. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Kisaragi:</b> Same.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> @P4, @StarTree?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> What about the shoe?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> The Darter might be on scene, but that isn't enough to show he is the murderer if the main cause of death is the sabotaged brake line. Where the car crashes is not the primary crime scene.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> üíü</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>P4:</b> P4 chooses Prey #2 also.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> There are eight players on Prey #2! StarTree doesn't know what to do!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It doesn't matter. I'll just round off.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> Should StarTree call Tanya to join?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> But she didn't play the whole game. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> What if the AFK players are the cover? Then Evelyn can get some detective credits!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I'll choose Prey #2 if that's okay.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Why? If you are joining now, you could just cover and Evelyn can get some credits. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Evelyn <i>may</i> also get credits for covering by herself. But I don't think she wants to take part in choosing a murderer.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Is that true, Evelyn?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I guess that's true. üòÖ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Wait a minute. I thought the deal with Evelyn joining was that if she got it right, she gets to rez the victim.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't think I know any of them enough to raise them.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> What do you need to know to save someone's life? XD If he was just hospitalized, you would have saved him, right? What is the difference if he was dead. ü§î</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't know. I need to know how they lived to tell if they will have the will to continue carrying the trauma. üòñ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> That makes no sense. XD As I said, if the victim was in a car crash and went into a coma, you would have saved him. You wouldn't have considered anything about trauma or their life. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Let's just continue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> ... Ok... I feel that I asked something I shouldn't have.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> It has to do with what rez means. Evelyn, it doesn't have to be the same as what you know. You can change it to what you want to happen.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> If you are continuing the conversation, they I would say why doesn't Red rez the victims? Red can rez also. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> üê£</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I'm okay with how the game has been. We are three AA short of any bonus clue. I say we don't make it to any bonus clue. So now it is drumroll time. Although the plan was to split the guessing and solution to another day, I forgot about it. So let's do it. The order is Seductress, Therapist, Last Caller, Darter. I'll have Tanya do some so that she can be considered a player this game.</hide>

  <div class="">üõéÔ∏è SOLUTION</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> The murderer was Prey #2!
  <div></div><b>Motive:</b> Revenge for the victim for pushing him to use that leg from the seductress's company, and for beating the Last Caller to avoid paying for child support. He planned to kill all three including the seductress and the therapist.
  <div></div><b>Means:</b> He search online for ways to plan a murder that looks like an accident. He used acid from work and bought Chilean saltpeter, and used the copper fitting from his failed prosthetic leg to make nitric acid. 
  <div></div><b>Opportunity:</b> The solution didn't really explain how he got to meddling the car, except that he knew beforehand that the victim drives that car. 
  <div></div><b>Aftermath:</b> Prey #2 is eventually prosecuted on first-degree murder charges.

But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage. If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage. The farmer‚Äôs challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?

Zoey notices that the pipe section that the robe is attached to is more shiny than the surrounding pipes. That section seems to be recently replaced, as there are still metal filings around it.

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Wait. The victim has his own card? Does that mean we haven't ruled out suicide?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I guess that is what that means. But since he was probably unconcious at the time of death, he probably didn't commit suicide.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I want to start with someone who would normally be in the house.</hide>

  <div class="">üîç [57] Older Brother</div><hide><hr>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> The question I really wanted to ask is <i>how</i> he discovered the body in the basement. Do we assume that he can enter the house? Or he peeked through a window to the basement? However, the next clue from him will most likely be about the argument.</hide>

  <div class="">üîç [142] Blogger</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Black searches online for the victim and finds a separatist blog that mentions the victim by name. The blog post calls for the death for many local people, and cites the victim as an example.

  <div></div><div class="" says StarTree.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> It might be a little early to speculate, but according to Evelyn's report, the victim was most like unconscious from alcohol at the time of death. So I am imagining the victim drank with someone he trusted, but his trusted person turned out to be a murderer. In that direction, the older brother is the prime suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That is possible.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Are we so good at it now that we can tell who the murderer is in round one?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Do I get extra credit if I pick now and the older brother turns out to be the murderer?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> If I give you a bonus now, it would be unfair to others who didn't get a bonus.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> But we have only played 5 games. The later you start the more unfairness the scoring remains.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> What do others think?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> How many games are there total?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> This game has 9 cases. We might replay case 1 where Tanya and I won't play. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I think players who explain their reasoning to help others understand should get detective credits.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I agree with Zoey.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> First, for my understanding, early guesses and explanations are welcomed. No one is saying that such discussion is spoiling the game. Is that correct?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I like the explanation.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think it is better with explanations. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay, how do people feel if a meritful detective comment is worth 0.1 credits?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I think it should be 1 credit or 1 detective EXP. We can use the same formula for the level by taking the square root.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay, so, suppose we go back to the old cases and tally the meritorious moments to get the EXP and Level. How many credits should it worth for guessing the correct suspect?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> It could be none, since with correct explanations, most, if not all, should reach the same conclusion, as what we have seen so far. Blind guesses shouldn't get any detective credits. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> In that scoring scheme, simply agreeing with someone would earn no EXP. You have to point out something new to get EXP. And if someone beats you to it, you don't get the EXP either I assume.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think that is fair </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> My impression is that if we do that, Ivy, Ledia, Tanya will be in the lead. StarTree, Red, P4 might have no EXP. Is that okay?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> But you only need to say one meritful thing that is detective/logical to be level 1. I don't think that would be too hard</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> In summary, the proposal is this: During the game, if you say anything meritful, you would get one daily merit EXP for the guild participation. That point maxes out at one EXP per day. On a completely separate scoring for detective EXP, you get one detective EXP per merit, with no daily maximum. To get those EXP, you don't need to be right in guessing the murderer, and guessing the murderer correctly doesn't award any detective EXP.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think being right should worth something.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think it is worth not having your merit EXP reevaluated and demerited. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think if you don't keep score on who is right, the game itself would be less fun.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> You may track your own success rate.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Fair enough.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. So I marked some lines from today where I think is worth Detective EXP. The tally is Ledia 3 EXP, Evelyn 1 EXP, Tanya 1 EXP. Any objection? (And those who are getting guild merit from this thread are Ivy, Ledia, Sasha, Tanya, Zoey.)</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Not an objection, but I think it is possible to tally detective EXP using JQuery, since a person can only get detective EXP from a thread.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I would like that upgrade.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> The thread would need tags such as <code>data-DXP-Ledia</code>.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> My script maker side is ready.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I added the function DXP. Have fun.</hide>

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I would like to do something like that for @Dungeon.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I have an idea. What if we multiply the EXP by the success rate to get the actual Detective EXP?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> That seems reasonable to me.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> What if someone only picks a suspect when it is easy?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> My impression is that all the cases are about the same difficulty, and we don't get a player who would join then choose not to pick a suspect when the case seems hard. So I don't think that is a problem.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I will think about it. I will make the code count how many games a person played and how many wins they have. For games where a player chose to cover, I would just have them choose the same as Tanya. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> What kind of comment do I need to make to get detective EXP?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Something that would help others be a better detective, that is not too obvious and said too often.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Like... we are looking for someone who is both Tech-savvy and Handy, and has a motive to kill the victim?</hide>

She is paranoided that they are out to get her.

  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Kisaragi:</b> I think the victim was hung elsewhere, then relocated to the basement. </hide>

  <div class="">üö® PLOT TWIST 3</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I made some slight changes to the scene. If it seems odd, it is because of my changes. In the original plot twist, the Reverend did not invite the detectives to have lunch with them. The detectives saw the older brother in the audience in one of the videos, and when they tried to find him at his pharmacist office, they learn that he is having lunch with the Reverend.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I made the change because in my subplot it is not obvious to the Reverend that Red is a detective. Red just appears to be a potential follower.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I kept the highlight that the older brother is a pharmacist because the victim was probably unconscious when he was killed. According to Evelyn.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. So the default setting of this round, Round 3, is that there are only 6 free clues. Round 4 will have only 2 free clues.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Before the plot twist, I would have suggested that we skip the brother and the reverend. It was because the brother had saved the victim twice, and the reverend is too open about his hostility to the victim. I think the reverend wants the victim dead, but did not commit the murder himself. That is why he feels so free talking about it.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> But in the case of the garden gnome secretary, she, the murderer, was also openly hostile to the victim. </hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [282] The Victim</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Evelyn:</b> Evelyn looks deeper into the victim's psychiatric file which states that the victim was diagnosed as manic depressive, capable of huge mood swings. During his lows, he can be withdrawn and intolerant of others. During his highs, he can be overly friendly and forgiving. His case file also says that he has an inability to read other people's intentions. 
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I'm sorry my clue doesn't seem very useful. üòñ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> A person who can take advantage of that would be the brother, and possibly the bully if he knew the victim enough.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [266] Headquarters</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>James:</b> James decides that the team can't have just one medical examiner so he checks the body and Evelyn's notes. The victim's arms have no signs of being tied up, yet his palms have abrasions. Did he regret and try to save himself? Or was it never meant to be real and he was surprised?
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> James's title is now Medical Examiner.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [102] Crime Scene</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> First, I think this witness has no reason to lie. So the Bully was lying about trying to avoid the victim.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Second, my impression from the neighbor's recount is that the victim and the Bully entered the hosue together, then the victim was killed, and the Bully replaced the step after the victim was killed.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> It is a bit metagaming, but I think such a strong association is coming too early for the Bully to be the murderer.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Three clues remaining for Round 3.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Another interpretation is that the sightings happen before the victim was murdered. The Bully and the Victim entered, the step broke, and the Bully fixed it. The victim was still alive when the Bully left. Then the brother came to look for the victim, possibly took the opportunity to kill the victim because he already got a noose on himself. But this won't make sense unless the brother now has a motive to kill his brother instead of save him.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I suggest we let go of the Reverend and the Blogger. I think if we talk to the brother we will know about the lunch meeting, and so far we have nothing that would connect the Blogger to the victim's house.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [20] Stalker</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class="" The victim's note says that he believed Ms. Stalker might take matters in her own hands.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I didn't find that clue very helpful.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [74] Older Brother</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class="" whispers the brother.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I suppose Red should know exactly what the fight was about, but since the clue is mysterious to me, I decided that it would better if I join the scene knowing nothing.</hide>
  <button class="" that would benefit might be the Bully. The Bully might go to the same church.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> One clue left for this round.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [217] Bully</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class="" 
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Kisaragi:</b> I think the Bully will tell us what the victim was planning to do, such as faking his own death to please someone or to start a new life. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Kisaragi:</b> If we believe that is true, then we might not need the fourth clue from him.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> The only two Tech-savvy persons are the Bully and the Blogger.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> *3B Sings*</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> 3B, help us. ü§ó *Evelyn sings*</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Actually I was wondering if it is too late to discuss manga draft.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay! There is no use overthinking before Plot Twist 4. Please return for the final round!</hide>

  <div class=""><b>This</b> is about drafting for Chapter 16 Page 12.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> On page 11, the team is bursting the bubbles while waiting for concrete examples of self-interest being good. Then Sasha appears with a card. What card will Sasha play?</hide>
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> I think it is better to play one at a time.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Then I play the  card. It is an example where being assertive to one's self-interest can prevent the group from doing something none of them want.
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> And what would be Zoey, Ledia, or Red's reaction to that card? I think Evelyn took "her turn" so I would prefer if one of the other three be the main responder.
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>LRRH:</b> I agree with the example. It is something I always want people to understand when I ask for their wishes. I want them to tell me what they <i>really</i> want instead of what they think is possible or compatible with others.
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> My plan is that when Sasha uses the card, the content of a bubble starts to take shape as a monster or something. Then when Red agrees with it, it either turns into an item or it gives Red an item.
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> Thus the questions: What things represents Abilene Paradox?
  <div></div><div class="">‚≠ê</div><b>Ledia:</b> The problem that knowing the Abilene Paradox would solve is a water element problem
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> I imagine a cactus. üåµ
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> May I know why?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> It stores excess water.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> Good idea.</hide>
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> I think next we need an example to bound the cactus. Or it would mean that being truthful to what one wants is <i>always</i> good.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> Isn't that somewhat good or almost always good? I don't need to find a counter example if I am not trying to argue that it is <i>always</i> good. 
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Let's say after Red makes friend with the cactus, it fires up and thinks that being truthful to one's self-interest is <i>always</i> good. Then what do you do?
  <div></div><b>3B:</b> I think I have enough for a page, and that is a good place to have Ledia or Zoey response. So please wait for me to draw it.
  <mbkudo>3B thanks all for the ideas.</mbkudo>

  <div></div><div class="" Zoey reports.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Only two free clues in this round. We are 1 AA short of a bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> *Sings*</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [158] Stalker</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Tanya:</b> Tanya interviews the Stalker's parole officer and learned that Ms Stalker's bunkmate in prison committed suicide with socks, after the Stalker took issue with the bunkmate being gay.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I didn't find that clue very helpful. I apologize. I was hoping that the stalker saw something about the victim.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> One free clue left and there is one bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I think the brother and the bully equally likely to have an alibi in their last clue. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I think it is safer to reveal a clue from headquarters or the crime scene, since we don't have any clue pointing to anyone specific.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> What is the odd that there is <i>more</i> to find at the crime scene? XD I say let's do both the headquarters and crime scene.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç [238] Headquarters</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class="">üíó</div><b>StarTree:</b> StarTree watches the unedited version of the decrypted video and sees the new pipe in place! The victim signaled to an off-camera helper, who moved the camera out of the way for a few seconds, then refocused the camera back on the victim, where the rope was re-positioned at the center at the new pipe section. That is when the video picks up where the edited version started!
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> The replacement of the pipe seems to be relevant to the murder. The Bully is my prime suspect.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Well we are out of free clues, so this is the time to make your choices. Ledia, Ivy, Kisaragi, 3B, Evelyn, Zoey, and StarTree may change their mind after bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> How does cover work?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Hmm... cover is for RP. For the win ratio, you have to pick one, or follow someone if you don't want to pick.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I cover and pick the victim. üòñ</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> So you think it was a suicide? What about the victim being unconscious?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> I don't know what happened, but doesn't the video showed that the victim was conscious since he signaled the camera person.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I pick the Bully. I think he might be lying about leaving once he learned about the victim's plan. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I pick the Bully, but I also want a bonus clue. üê£</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Four AA short of second bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Kisaragi:</b> Bully.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> When in doubt, follow the crowd. XD At least if we fail I am not behind. XD. Bully</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> It is definitely easier to pick having contributed to bonus clue. Bully.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> Bully.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It makes no sense not to contribute. Arcacia help us! I pick the vicim for now.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Two more AA for bonus clue #2. So. The way it works is that after revealing bonus clue #1, everyone who got an AA can change their mind. But after revealing bonus clue #2, only those who got two AA can change their mind.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledai:</b> That seems fair.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> StarTree picks the Bully because StarTree imagines him to be the best at editting videos!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> Bully. There is no evidence linking anyone else at the moment.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Bonus clue 2 unlocked.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> Would someone who has just been released from prison be so eager in murder? I pick the brother.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> But there is no physical evidence pointing to him.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I just thought that the chance of a negative proof with the bully is high. I didn't plan to get an Arcacia Award.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Is @James picking a suspect? We'll continue with Bonus Clue #1 next.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>James:</b> I pick the victim. He did try to kill himself twice.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> This is like Arcacia giving everyone a second chance since we are all wrong. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. There is no third bonus clue. I will let those who only got one AA decide on the first bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> I think it is worth using it on the Bully in case he has a compelling excuse. We only have this chance to save ourselves.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> It is first come first serve. So let's do it!</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">‚≠ê [183] Bully</div><hide><hr>
  <h4>Bonus Clue 1</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Ivy:</b> The piple section that Zoey brought back after the rain has a shred of fingernail matching the Bully's DNA.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> I think this points to the Bully replaced a pipe that is would break to one that would not break. As a result, the victim is dead. I am staying with my choice.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>James:</b> I switch to the Bully.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I switch also.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> @Evelyn, Tanya?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I am convinced. Switch.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Evelyn:</b> Please let me switch also. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Now we are unanimous. Which is actually how the game was designed to be.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Ivy, Zoey, and StarTree can pick the second bonus clue.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> Let's finish the crime scene.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">‚≠ê [31] Crime Scene</div><hide><hr>
  <h4>Bonus Clue 2</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Zoey:</b> First the step, then the pipe. Who was trying to make sure that suicide succeed? Was it the victim or the assistant?
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ivy:</b> As I said, since the chiseled pipe has DNA of the Bully, the evidence points to the Bully to be the one not surprised at the victim's death. </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> I know. But that was the clue. It is redundant. XD</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Ledia:</b> It seems that the game wants us to win.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Okay. Drumroll!</hide>
  </hide></div>

  <div class="">ü•Å [261] The Victim</div><hide><hr>
  <h4>Unused Round 4 Clue</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>James:</b> James the detective thinks that the murderer replaced the pipe so that noose would kill, and chiseled the step so that the victim could not save himself.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>James:</b> After the murder, the murderer replace the broken step to make it look like the victim could have saved himself if he didn't mean to commit suicide.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Next is the solution, will everyone get it right?</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üõéÔ∏è SOLUTION</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> The murderer is the Bully!
  <div></div><b>Motive:</b> The Bully wanted revenge against the victim for putting him in prison despite the victim had forgiven him.
  <div></div><b>Opportunity:</b> The victim wanted to be friend with the Bully when the Bully was released from prison. He even offered to hire him for the project of faking his own death. 
  <div></div><b>Means:</b> The victim wanted to fake and boardcast his own suicide for the town to see, but the Bully took advantage and rigged the pipe and the step. The victim's plan was for the pipe to snap as needed, but the Bully replace that with a pipe that would not snap. The victim planned to jump off a step after putting on the noose. But the Bully modified the step so that the step would break when the victim steps on it after putting on the noose.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> The goal of this game is to solve the case with fewer clues than Holmes. The players cooperate, but each player decide which clue to reveal in their turn. We track each clue that we reveal. When we think that we have revealed enough clues (or earlier), we can see the questions we need to answer to earn points. Then based on our answers and the number of clues we used, we will get a score. If our score is more than 100, then we beat Holmes.

  <div class="">üö® Case Info: November 19, 1885</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Amelia:</b> Our client is a governess who was kidnapped on November 16 (Mon) and was released the next day in the afternoon. She is afraid that she would be kidnapped again and wanted our help to identify the kidnappers. She was blindfolded all the way. From what she could hear, she believes that she was brought outside the city, and there were at least two kidnappers, one of them might be a woman according to her voice. She heard from kidnappers conversation that because no one was paying the ransom, so they decide to release her. 
  <div></div><b>Amelia:</b> According to the newspaper on November 19, 1885, the police believes that the kidnappers also kidnapped someone from the Dunsworthy family.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> What is a governess?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> It is a private nanny.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> What is laudanum?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> It is a 10% percent 
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> So we will take turn deciding what clue to reveal.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> The directory shows only one address for Dunsworthy family, 43SW.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> My suggestion is to go to Scotland Yard to get the police report of the Dunsworthy case.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç 13 SW Scotland Yard</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Black:</b> Black goes to Scotland Yard for the police report on the previous kidnapping of the Mary Dunsworthy. In that case, Lady Dunsworthy paid ransom. The victim was released before they family informed the police. The inspector said if we want more information we could ask Murray the Criminiologist.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> This report wasn't as informative as I expected. Maybe if we want more information we need to visit the Dunsworthy.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> Or the victim Wendy Sturton's family.</hide>
  <button class="" is not in the directory!</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç 43 SW Dunsworthy</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>44:</b> Lady Dunsworthy is an old lady with French accent. August 25, the driver of the daughter saw struck from behind after stopping. Details were similar for the Wendy Sturton kidnap. Mary Dunsworthy was kidnapped for about a week. The fireplace was burning all the time.
  <hr class="">
  <button class="" that is burning all the time might be some type of oven in a factory, since it was in the summer.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç 22 SW Murray (Criminologist) [C]</div><hide><hr>
  <h4>Base Clue</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Amelia:</b> Amelia visits the criminologist for further information. The criminologist says that the two kidnappings don't seem to be done by the same group. The second group seems to have copied the first group by writing similar notes (but with different handwriting), and with a similar red scarf for the blindfold (but with different material for the scarf), and the ropes for tying were of different thickness. The mud at the bottom of their shoes were also different, which he had sent to our office. <b>Circle C needed for the rest of the clues.</b>
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> The first red scarf was made of cotton, the second made of cotton and silk. I think maybe Lady Dunsworthy did the copycat kidnap to recoup the ransom money, but gave up after learning the second family won't pay.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç 42 NW 221B Baker Street [C, F, J, T, Z]</div><hide><hr>
  <h4>Base Clue</h4>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> Holmes looked at the mud sample and said it is uncontaminated, clearly not from the London streets. He asked us to determine whether the kidnapping was done by the same gang who took Mary Dunsworthy, if not, who might have done it since the press did not report many facts, and why Wendy Sturton (instead of another governess) was kidnapped considering her habits.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> I think we already have answers to the first two question. About Ms. Sturton's habit: She likes to walk alone at the park in the early morning. But her kidnapping did not occur when she was doing that walk. She was kidnapped in the afternoon on her way to get medicine. She went because the bottle was empty. She was kidnapping not during her routine. Why didn't the kidnapper kidnap her when she was in the park?</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç 61 NW Kenneth Train</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> Sasha visits Kenneth Train, the family where Wendy is a governess. Mr. Train says the note demanded  ¬£2000 by dawn of the next day, which is nearly impossible to arrange, even though he does have a rich uncle (who did reply the next day that he could assist partially). Mrs Train seems sad at the visit. Mr. Train explains that his wife is stressed by various unfortunate events this year: She herself getting sick, her daugther coughing, and his mother's dying. 
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> I think maybe Laetitia Train (the wife), who knows that his husband's uncle is rich, and planned the kidnapping. So she wants to get money to treat her daughter's illness.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> She might have learned the details about the Dunsworth case from someone of the Dunsworth family.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Casey:</b> I was just wondering if the kidnapper used their own carriage or hired a carriage. But there is no clue at 5 WC.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç 75 SW Sally Train</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Amelia:</b> The newspaper has an obituary of Sally Train, who I think is the death mother of Mr. Train. At her address, her house is for sale and her brother is in charge of the sales.
  <hr class="">
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Amelia:</b> I think we can check the brother for clues next.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> But how would that be related to the case? We lose points if we follow irrelevant leads.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> Isn't the scoring wrong? Shouldn't it reward detectives for being thorough?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I think when we see how it is scored after this game we will know if it is fair.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> But the brother is the <i>uncle</i> who might help pay.</hide>
  </hide></div>
  <div class="">üîç 62 SW Laurence Yale (Sally Train's brother)</div><hide><hr>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>44:</b> We tried to talk to the uncle but his bulter turned us away.

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> We think we are close but stuck. This is a recap of the questions.
  <h4>First Series</h4>
  <div></div><b>Question 1-1:</b> Who kidnapped Wendy Sturton?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> Patrick, Grace, and Maxwell (The Police Officer).</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> Why didn't they just say the park was closed?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I think that is because if they put a sign or tell Wendy that the park is closed, people can ask about it and they would be found out.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> I think the police officer didn't take part in the kidnapping because he seemed to have connected the dots only after the detectives asked about it.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>44:</b> Then Patrick and Grace only, since Wendy's account just said two people.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Amelia:</b> Is the Train house close to Pickwick house?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> The Train House is in NW the Pickwick house is in SW!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Black:</b> A question remainis on how the kidnappers know when Wendy would exit the Train house, and why didn't the kidnappers kidnapper her at the park if they know her routine.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Question 1-2:</b> Why?
  <div></div><b>Question 1-3:</b> What was Constable Ponsford's involvement?
  <div></div><b>Question 1-4:</b> What deal was being done?

  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>Sasha:</b> This section is for discussing about our playing of the game.
  <div></div><b>Sasha:</b> Next time I will scan and make copies of the case book because it is <i>THE</i> bottleneck. Unlike NCIS, we can't eaily take pictures or share. The clues of NCIS is short and easy to summarize. This game the clues are long and we need to revisit or we would miss details.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> I also need more ideas on how to make the gameplay better so we can play the next one.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Sasha:</b> And I have problem taking notes fast enough.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Black:</b> I think we need Motive, Means, Opportunity information on the prime suspects, and our chat should really be split per day.

  <div class=""><b>This</b> is about drafting for Chapter 16 Page 13.
  
  </div><hr class="">
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>3B:</b> The content of page 12 is a lot different from what we planned because Sasha wanted to use the water element already on stage to cast flash flood.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> It is an AE attack, but I think it would be better if someone other than Evelyn responds.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> In the last panel of page 12, I drew Zoey holding onto a rope. Sasha is going to cut the rope if that rope does not have a philosophical meaning.</hide>
  <div></div><div class=""></div><b>LRRH:</b> I jump onto the turtle also because I agree that self-interest is good sometimes, like when I am asking people for wishes.
  <div></div><div class="" are different. Self-Interest is a motive. A personal desire is not necessarily a motive.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Zoey:</b> A person can have a personal desire, but they may not be acting on it </hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think we need a node defining Self-Interest.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>LRRH:</b> Don't we already have a motivation node?</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> It was a section in the <lnk>202209020848|Compassion</lnk> node!</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> @StarTree please split that into its own node.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>StarTree:</b> <lnk>202212282320|Wee~~!</lnk></hide>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> When Red wants to know what people wish for, she doesn't mean that she wants people to *only* act based on <i>self-interest</i>. She just means that she doesn't want people to hide their <i>personal desires</i>.
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> It is a subtle difference.</hide>
  <div></div><b>Zoey:</b> For example, in the case of the Abilene Paradox, a solution is people pursuring their self-interesting. Another solution is people disclosing their personal preferences and desires. A person does not need to be motivated by self-interest to disclose their personal preferences and desires.
  <div></div><b>LRRH:</b> What is the difference between motivation and desire?
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>Tanya:</b> I think desire is a broader term than motivation. You could have a desire that something happens, but no motivation to act toward it.</hide>
  <button class=""></div></button><hide> <b>3B:</b> I think we also need comments on Motivation vs Self-Interest vs Other-Interest, and a node on Abilene Paradox itself with solutions. Let's continue next time.</hide>
  <mbkudo>3B thanks all for the ideas.</mbkudo>
